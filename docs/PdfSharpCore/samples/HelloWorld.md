# Hello World

Is the obligatory "Hello World" program.


## Code

```cs
using PdfSharpCore.Drawing;
using PdfSharpCore.Fonts;
using PdfSharpCore.Pdf;
using PdfSharpCore.Utils;

// The one line the upstream sample has no need of. PdfSharpCore carries no font dependency
// of its own, so a backend has to supply the resolver, and it must be set before any font is
// created - the setter throws once one has been.
GlobalFontSettings.FontResolver = new SkiaFontResolver();

// Create a new PDF document
PdfDocument document = new PdfDocument();
document.Info.Title = "Created with PdfSharpCore";

// Create an empty page
PdfPage page = document.AddPage();

// Get an XGraphics object for drawing
XGraphics gfx = XGraphics.FromPdfPage(page);

// Create a font. Whether a family name resolves is the resolver's business, not the
// library's: SkiaFontResolver asks the machine, so "Verdana" works on Windows and does not
// on a Linux agent with no fonts installed. A program that must lay out identically
// everywhere ships its own faces - see FontResolver.md.
XFont font = new XFont("Verdana", 20, XFontStyle.BoldItalic);

// Draw the text
gfx.DrawString(
    "Hello, World!", font, XBrushes.Black,
    new XRect(0, 0, page.Width, page.Height),
    XStringFormats.Center);

// Save the document...
document.Save("HelloWorld.pdf");
```

The namespaces are `PdfSharpCore.*`, not `PdfSharp.*` — this is a fork, and code copied from
PDFsharp's own documentation will not compile until the `using` lines are changed.
