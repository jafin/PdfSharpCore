This sample shows how to create PDF annotations.

PdfSharpCore supports the creation of the following annotations:
* [Text annotations](#text-annotations)
* [Text annotations opened](#text-annotations-opened)
* [Rubber stamp annotations](#rubber-stamp-annotations)
* [Text markup annotations](#text-markup-annotations) — highlight, underline, strike out and squiggly


## Text annotations

```cs
// Create a PDF text annotation
PdfTextAnnotation textAnnot = new PdfTextAnnotation();
textAnnot.Title = "This is the title";
textAnnot.Subject = "This is the subject";
textAnnot.Contents = "This is the contents of the annotation.\rThis is the 2nd line.";
textAnnot.Icon = PdfTextAnnotationIcon.Note;
 
gfx.DrawString("The first text annotation", font, XBrushes.Black, 30, 50, XStringFormats.Default);
 
// Convert rectangle from world space to page space. This is necessary because the annotation is
// placed relative to the bottom left corner of the page with units measured in point.
XRect rect = gfx.Transformer.WorldToDefaultPage(new XRect(new XPoint(30, 60), new XSize(30, 30)));
textAnnot.Rectangle = new PdfRectangle(rect);
 
// Add the annotation to the page
page.Annotations.Add(textAnnot);
```


## Text annotations opened
```cs
// Create another PDF text annotation which is open and transparent
textAnnot = new PdfTextAnnotation();
textAnnot.Title = "Annotation 2 (title)";
textAnnot.Subject = "Annotation 2 (subject)";
textAnnot.Contents = "This is the contents of the 2nd annotation.";
textAnnot.Icon = PdfTextAnnotationIcon.Help;
textAnnot.Color = XColors.LimeGreen;
textAnnot.Opacity = 0.5;
textAnnot.Open = true;
 
gfx.DrawString("The second text annotation (opened)", font, XBrushes.Black, 30, 140, XStringFormats.Default);
 
rect = gfx.Transformer.WorldToDefaultPage(new XRect(new XPoint(30, 150), new XSize(30, 30)));
textAnnot.Rectangle = new PdfRectangle(rect);
 
// Add the 2nd annotation to the page
page.Annotations.Add(textAnnot);
```


## Rubber stamp annotations

```cs
// Create a so called rubber stamp annotation. I'm not sure if it is useful, but at least
// it looks impressive...
PdfRubberStampAnnotation rsAnnot = new PdfRubberStampAnnotation();
rsAnnot.Icon = PdfRubberStampAnnotationIcon.TopSecret;
rsAnnot.Flags = PdfAnnotationFlags.ReadOnly;
 
rect = gfx.Transformer.WorldToDefaultPage(new XRect(new XPoint(100, 400), new XSize(350, 150)));
rsAnnot.Rectangle = new PdfRectangle(rect);
 
// Add the rubber stamp annotation to the page
page.Annotations.Add(rsAnnot);
```


## Text markup annotations

These mark up a run of text on the page: `PdfHighlightAnnotation` washes it with colour,
`PdfUnderlineAnnotation` rules a line beneath it, `PdfStrikeOutAnnotation` rules one through it, and
`PdfSquigglyAnnotation` rules a wavy one beneath it. All four are used the same way.

```cs
gfx.DrawString("Hello world!", font, XBrushes.Black, 30, 42, XStringFormats.Default);

var highlight = new PdfHighlightAnnotation();
highlight.Title = "This is the title";
highlight.Contents = "This is the contents of the annotation.";
highlight.Color = XColors.Yellow;

// Convert the band to cover from world space to page space, as for the other annotations.
highlight.AddQuad(gfx.Transformer.WorldToDefaultPage(new XRect(new XPoint(30, 30), new XSize(70, 16))));

page.Annotations.Add(highlight);
```

A run of text is not a rectangle — it wraps — so what is marked up is a list of quadrilaterals
rather than a single box, one per line or per word. Call `AddQuad` once for each:

```cs
var strikeOut = new PdfStrikeOutAnnotation();
foreach (var line in linesOfTheParagraph)
    strikeOut.AddQuad(gfx.Transformer.WorldToDefaultPage(line));
page.Annotations.Add(strikeOut);
```

The annotation rectangle is then the box enclosing the quadrilaterals, and is kept up to date for
you. Setting `Rectangle` and adding no quadrilaterals at all marks up that rectangle alone, which is
the simple case; adding one takes over from it.

`Opacity` applies as it does to the other annotations. A highlight is drawn under the Multiply blend
mode, so the text keeps showing through the colour rather than being painted over by it.

PDF supports some more pretty types of annotations like PdfLineAnnotation, PdfSquareAnnotation,
PdfCircleAnnotation, PdfSoundAnnotation, or PdfMovieAnnotation.
If you need one of them, feel encouraged to implement it. It is quite easy.
