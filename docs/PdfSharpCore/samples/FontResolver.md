This sample shows how to use fonts that are included with your application. This allows you to use fonts that are not installed on the computer.


## There is no default font resolver

**This fork ships none, and that is deliberate.** The core package carries no font dependency of its
own, so `GlobalFontSettings.FontResolver` starts unset and throws a descriptive
`InvalidOperationException` when read. One of the backend packages has to supply it:

```cs
GlobalFontSettings.FontResolver = new SkiaFontResolver();          // PdfSharpCore.Skia
GlobalFontSettings.FontResolver = new ImageSharpFontResolver();    // PdfSharpCore.ImageSharp
```

Both are built on [`FontResolverBase`](../../../PdfSharpCore/Utils/FontResolverBase.cs), which does
the searching, and both use the fonts installed on the operating system. The directories searched
depend on which one that is — see
[`LinuxSystemFontResolver`](../../../PdfSharpCore/Utils/LinuxSystemFontResolver.cs) for the Linux
list:

**Windows**
1. `%SystemRoot%\Fonts`
1. `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Fonts`

**Linux**
1. `/usr/share/fonts`
1. `/usr/local/share/fonts`
1. `~/.fonts`

**iOS**
1. `/Library/Fonts/`


## Custom font resolver

When running on web services or servers, the operating system might **not** have the fonts installed you need or you can **not** install the font you need.
In this scenario you must provide the fonts yourself and therefore implement your own font resolver.

### IFontResolver interface

In your application you create a class that implements the `IFontResolver` interface.

There are three members. The first returns a `FontResolverInfo` for every supported font, or `null`
where the request cannot be satisfied.

```cs
public FontResolverInfo ResolveTypeface(string familyName, bool isBold, bool isItalic)
```

The second is called using the `FaceName` from the `FontResolverInfo` you previously returned. At
this stage, return the font data as a byte array.

```cs
public byte[] GetFont(string faceName)
```

The third names the family to fall back on when nothing else has been asked for — MigraDoc's image
placeholder draws its message in it, for one.

```cs
public string DefaultFontName { get; }
```

Now you only need one more step: register your font resolver using the global font resolver property.
Here MyFontResolver is the class that implements `IFontResolver`.

```cs
GlobalFontSettings.FontResolver = new MyFontResolver();
```

Note: The `FontResolver` is a global object and applies to all consumers of the PdfSharpCore library. It is also used when the MigraDocCore library creates PDF files.

**Set it before any font is created.** The setter throws once one has been, because a face already
resolved cannot be un-resolved and the two answers would disagree about what a family name means.

If you also draw text as outlines with `XGraphicsPath.AddString`, register a
`GlobalFontSettings.GlyphOutlineProvider` as well. That seam can be set, replaced or cleared at any
time, but a provider takes its font bytes *through* `FontResolver` rather than resolving a family
itself — or the two will disagree about which face a family means.

### Code

This implementation is obviously not complete.
But it should be enough for everyone to implement their own.
For more details have a look at
[`FontResolverBase`](../../../PdfSharpCore/Utils/FontResolverBase.cs), which both shipped resolvers
are built on, or at
[`BundledFontResolver`](../../../SampleApp/Infrastructure/BundledFontResolver.cs), which serves
faces out of the assembly exactly as this page describes so that the demos lay out identically
wherever they are built.

```cs
using System;
using System.IO;
using PdfSharpCore.Fonts;

public class MyFontResolver : IFontResolver
{
    public string DefaultFontName => "OpenSans";

    public FontResolverInfo ResolveTypeface(string familyName, bool isBold, bool isItalic)
    {
        if (familyName.Equals("OpenSans", StringComparison.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase))
        {
            if (isBold && isItalic)
            {
                return new FontResolverInfo("OpenSans-BoldItalic.ttf");
            }
            else if (isBold)
            {
                return new FontResolverInfo("OpenSans-Bold.ttf");
            }
            else if (isItalic)
            {
                return new FontResolverInfo("OpenSans-Italic.ttf");
            }
            else
            {
                return new FontResolverInfo("OpenSans-Regular.ttf");
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
    
    public byte[] GetFont(string faceName)
    {
        var faceNamePath = Path.Join("my path", faceName);
        using(var ms = new MemoryStream())
        {
            try
            {
                using(var fs = File.OpenRead(faceNamePath))
                {
                    fs.CopyTo(ms);
                    ms.Position = 0;
                    return ms.ToArray();
                }
            }
            catch (Exception e)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(e);
                throw new Exception($"No Font File Found - " + faceNamePath);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
