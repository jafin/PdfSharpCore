# Spec — What testing the charting renderers found, and what was done about it

`PdfSharpCore.Charting` had no tests. The whole assembly measured 0% of lines, and the ten
highest-CRAP methods in the fork were all in it — `YAxisRenderer.FineTuneYAxis` at 2,162, then the
axis, plot area and data label renderers behind it.

`PdfSharpCore.Charting.Tests` covers them. Every renderer in the package is `internal` and this
repository carries no `InternalsVisibleTo`, so the tests reach them the way a caller does: a `Chart`
handed to a `ChartFrame`, drawn onto a page, saved, reopened, and read back out of the content
stream. That has a consequence worth stating plainly — **everything below was reachable through
public API**. None of it needed reflection to find, and none of it needed reflection to hit.

Eight defects came out of it — seven from writing the tests, one more from review of the fixes.
All eight are now fixed, and the test that recorded each has been turned round to assert the
behaviour that replaced it.

| # | finding | severity | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | A chart with no X axis writes `NaN` coordinates to the page | **high** | **fixed** |
| C2 | `Series.AddBlank` throws when the chart is drawn | **high** | **fixed** |
| C3 | A blank category throws on a bar chart and is skipped on a column chart | medium | **fixed** |
| C4 | Fewer categories than values throws on a bar chart and is tolerated on a column chart | medium | **fixed** |
| C5 | A frame too small for its axes throws from inside `XRect` | medium | **fixed** |
| C6 | An axis title's alignment moves it nowhere, or only sometimes | low | **fixed** (see below) |
| C7 | `DataLabelPosition.InsideBase` stacks every pie label on one point | low | **fixed** |
| C8 | A chart with nothing plotted throws before it draws | medium | **fixed** |

C3 and C4 were one shape seen twice: two renderers written as copies of each other, which had
drifted apart on which inputs they survive. C1 and C8 were another, seen four times over: a
collection created lazily by its property and then read through its field.

Fixing them took the assembly from 71.09% of lines to 71.73%, and branch coverage from 64.28% to
67.10% — the rise is dead branches becoming reachable rather than new tests. Eight of the ten
hotspot methods are now at 100% of statements and none is below 97%.

## C1. A chart with no X axis wrote `NaN` to the page — fixed

`Chart.XAxis` creates the axis the first time it is read, so a chart nothing configured has none:

```csharp
var chart = new Chart(ChartType.Column2D);
chart.XValues.AddXSeries().Add("A", "B");
chart.SeriesCollection.AddSeries().Add(1.0, 2.0);
// drawn into a ChartFrame, the content stream read:
//   NaN NaN NaN 200 re
//   f
```

`HorizontalXAxisRenderer.Init` put its scale calculation inside a null check, so with no axis
`MaximumScale` kept its default of zero. `ColumnLikePlotAreaRenderer.Format` then built the plot
area's matrix by dividing by it — `width / 0` is infinity, `0 * infinity` is `NaN`, and `NaN` is
what `XGraphicsPdfRenderer` wrote. The draw succeeded and the file was written; a reader got a page
whose content stream will not parse. PdfSharpCore's own content lexer answered it with
`KeyNotFoundException: The given key 'NaN' was not present in the dictionary`.

The value axis renderer had never had this problem, and its shape was the fix.
`VerticalYAxisRenderer.Init` calls `InitScale` **before** it asks whether the axis object exists,
leaving only the labelling inside the question. Both X axis renderers now do the same:

```csharp
xari.axis = chart.xAxis;
CalculateXAxisValues(chart, xari);     // outside the check, as InitScale always was
if (xari.axis != null)
{
  InitTickLabels(xari, cri.DefaultFont);
  ...
}
```

`CalculateXAxisValues` reached the series collection through `rendererInfo.axis.parent`, which is
the one thing not available when there is no axis, so it now takes the chart — which `Init` already
had in hand.

A chart with no category axis is therefore drawn correctly and merely goes unlabelled, which is
exactly what a chart with no value axis had always done.

Pinned by `ChartFrameTests.AChartWithNoXAxisIsStillDrawnAgainstItsData` and
`.AChartWithNoXAxisGoesUnlabelled`.

**Why nothing had noticed:** MigraDoc's chart mapper builds both axes unconditionally, so a chart
reached through a `Document` never took this path. It was only reachable by using
`PdfSharpCore.Charting` directly, which is what the package is for.

---

## C2. `Series.AddBlank` threw when the chart was drawn — fixed

```csharp
var series = chart.SeriesCollection.AddSeries();
series.Add(1.0);
series.AddBlank();
// NullReferenceException in VerticalYAxisRenderer.CalcYAxis
```

`AddBlank` is public, is documented as "Adds a blank to the series", and puts a `null` into the
element collection. The pass that found the smallest and largest value walked those elements
testing each for `NaN` without first testing it for `null`, so the one thing the method exists to
permit was the one thing the renderer could not survive.

Guarding that one walk was not enough — a blank has to survive the whole draw, and about fifteen
places read a point's value. Rather than fifteen null tests, `PointRendererInfo` grew the concept:

```csharp
/// <summary>The value this point plots, or NaN if there is nothing to plot.</summary>
internal double Value => this.point == null ? double.NaN : this.point.value;
```

NaN because a blank was already the same thing to a renderer as a point whose value is NaN — there
is nothing to draw and nothing to add to a total — and because every comparison against NaN is
false, so a blank falls out of a range test on its own and the `IsNaN` tests already written against
missing values now catch both kinds of missing. Reading through `Value` instead of through `point`
is what keeps a blank from being dereferenced, and it simplified four sites that were already
testing `column.point != null && !double.IsNaN(column.point.value)`.

Four places needed more than the substitution:

- The two base `CalcYAxis` implementations walk `series.Elements` rather than renderer infos, and
  took the plain `point != null` guard the stacked overrides already had.
- The column and bar data label renderers would have written the word `NaN` onto the plot area.
  They now leave a blank with no text at all, which their own `Draw` already passes over.
- `ColumnStackedPlotAreaRenderer.IsDataInside` returned `true` unconditionally — a stacked column is
  inside the scale by construction — and so drew a blank with a null brush. It now answers
  `!double.IsNaN(yValue)`: always inside, provided there is a value at all.
- `LinePlotAreaRenderer` and `AreaPlotAreaRenderer` read `sri.series.Elements[idx].Value` directly.
  Both already mapped a NaN value to zero, and a blank now joins it there.

That is `BlankType.NotPlotted`, which is what `Chart.DisplayBlanksAs` defaults to — see *What is
still open* below.

Pinned by `ValueAxisScaleTests.ABlankInASeriesIsLeftOutOfTheScale`, `.ABlankInASeriesIsNotDrawn`,
`.ASeriesOfNothingButBlanksIsGivenARangeToDrawAgainst` and `.EveryChartTypeSurvivesABlank`.

**Side effect:** this reached the first case of `FineTuneYAxis` —

```csharp
if (yMin == double.MaxValue && yMax == double.MinValue)
{
  // No series data given.
  yMin = 0.0f;
  yMax = 0.9f;
}
```

— which a series of nothing but blanks is the only way to produce, and which nothing could reach
while a series of nothing but blanks threw. `FineTuneYAxis` is now at 100% of its statements.

---

## C3, C4. The vertical category axis renderer was missing two guards — fixed

`HorizontalXAxisRenderer.Draw` and `VerticalXAxisRenderer.Draw` are the same method with the axes
swapped. The horizontal one read:

```csharp
for (int idx = 0; idx < countTickLabels && idx < xs.Count; ++idx)
{
  XValue xv = xs[idx];
  if (xv != null)
```

and the vertical one read:

```csharp
for (int idx = countTickLabels - 1; idx >= 0; --idx)
{
  XValue xv = xs[idx];
  string tickLabel = xv.Value;
```

Two guards short, and each was a throw rather than a wrong picture: a category added with
`XSeries.AddBlank` is `null` (`NullReferenceException`), and `countTickLabels` comes from the
longest *series* rather than from the category list, so a chart with three values and two categories
asked for a third that was not there (`ArgumentOutOfRangeException`).

Both conditions are now carried across, in `Draw` and in `Format`, which measures the same labels
and had the same gap. Reversed iteration makes the bound part of the same expression:

```csharp
XValue xv = idx < xs.Count ? xs[idx] : null;
if (xv != null)
```

A blank category keeps its place on the axis rather than closing up over the gap, which is what the
horizontal renderer has always done.

## C5. A frame too small for its axes threw from inside `XRect` — fixed

Both plot area renderers open by returning if there is no room to draw in, which reads as a decision
already taken that a chart too small should draw nothing. It was unreachable.
`ColumnLikeChartRenderer.CalcLayout` subtracts the axes from the frame and assigns the remainder as
a width, and `XRect.Width` refuses a negative one:

```text
System.ArgumentException: WidthCannotBeNegative
  at PdfSharpCore.Drawing.XRect.set_Width
  at PdfSharpCore.Charting.Renderers.AreaRendererInfo.set_Width
  at PdfSharpCore.Charting.Renderers.ColumnLikeChartRenderer.CalcLayout
```

What a caller got was an exception three frames down naming a rectangle rather than the chart, at a
size that depends on how wide the tick labels measure in the resolved font — so not a threshold
anyone could be warned about.

Two changes, in one place each rather than at the four layout sites:

- `AreaRendererInfo.Width` and `.Height` take an extent below zero as no extent. Every layout in the
  package works by subtraction, so this is where a negative one can arise at all. `AxisRendererInfo`
  overrides both to size an inner rectangle as well, and clamps that too.
- The guard itself was `XRect.IsEmpty`, which means *the empty rectangle* — a width below zero —
  rather than *no room*. Nothing produces the empty rectangle now, so the eight sites that asked
  moved to `Renderer.HasNoRoom`, which asks what was meant:
  `area.Width <= 0 || area.Height <= 0`.

types, and `.AFrameTooSmallForItsAxesStillWritesNoNaN`.

## C6. An axis title's alignment moved it nowhere, or only sometimes — fixed

`AxisTitle.Alignment` and `AxisTitle.VerticalAlignment` are public and settable, and what they did
depended on which axis the title was on and whether it was turned. Three separate causes, two of
them fixed outright and one of them a constraint rather than a bug.

**The category axis read neither setting.** `AxisTitleRenderer` was never constructed for it:
`HorizontalXAxisRenderer.Draw` and `VerticalXAxisRenderer.Draw` each ended by drawing the caption
themselves, so a caption on a category axis was written flat and in the middle whatever it was asked
for. Both now hand the caption to `AxisTitleRenderer`, as the value axis renderers always have,
after setting its rectangle to the strip the axis has to place it in — the full width of the axis
for a horizontal one, the full height for a vertical one. Alignment and orientation both work there
now, and the two axes no longer take different code paths to draw the same kind of object.

Both axes also now *measure* their title through `AxisTitleRenderer.Format`, which is the only place
that accounts for an orientation. Measuring the string by hand, as the category axis renderers did,
reserved the room a rotated caption would have taken lying flat.

The hand-written version carried a small arithmetic error too: the caption was centred on
`xari.Rect.Right / 2`, half of the axis's right edge, rather than on the middle of the axis. The two
are the same only when the axis starts at zero, which it never does — the value axis is to its left.

**A rotated caption's `Bottom` landed where `Center` did.** The two cases are written separately —
`y + height / 2` against `y + height - layout.Height / 2` — but `layout` was the strip rather than
the caption, so the height being halved was the same height on both sides of the subtraction and the
second expression reduced to the first. `AxisTitleRenderer.Format` now records the measured caption
in `AxisTitleRendererInfo.AxisTitleSize`, which existed for exactly that and which only the X axis
renderers were filling in, and `Draw` measures its offsets against the caption instead of against
the strip. The three vertical alignments are now three positions.

**Across the axis, a rotated value-axis caption still does not move, and cannot.** The strip the
axis sets aside for its title is exactly as wide as the title, because that is how much room the
axis took from the plot area for it. All three alignments put the caption in the middle of that
strip, which is the only place it fits. `Left` used to come out elsewhere by putting the caption's
centre on the strip's near edge, so half of it hung outside the reserved space; landing with the
other two is the correction rather than a loss. Giving that setting somewhere to move to would mean
reserving more width than the caption needs and taking it from the plot area, which is a layout
decision rather than a defect.

The same holds of an upright value-axis caption: it aligns vertically, within the height of the
axis, and not horizontally, within a strip its own width.

## C7. `DataLabelPosition.InsideBase` stacked every pie label on one point — fixed

```csharp
dleri.X = origin.X;
dleri.Y = origin.Y;
if (dleri.X < origin.X)          // cannot be: it was just set to origin.X
  dleri.X -= dleri.Width;
if (dleri.Y < origin.Y)          // likewise
  dleri.Y -= dleri.Height;
```

The two adjustments were copied from the `OutsideEnd` case above, where the comparison means
something because the position came from an angle. Here the point was being compared with itself, so
neither ran, and a four-wedge pie asked for `InsideBase` drew four labels at one point.

The tests are now on the direction the wedge runs in, which is what they were reaching for:

```csharp
if (Math.Cos(radMidAngle) < 0)
  dleri.X -= dleri.Width;
if (Math.Sin(radMidAngle) < 0)
  dleri.Y -= dleri.Height;
```

Each label is laid out away from the centre along its own wedge, so the corner of it nearest the
centre is the one that sits there and each quadrant gets a corner of its own. The position also now
keeps its labels nearer the middle than any of the other three, which is what its name says.

## C8. A chart with nothing plotted threw before it drew — fixed

Found by review of the fixes above rather than by the tests. Copilot pointed at
`CalculateXAxisValues` and observed that `MaximumScale` is zero when a chart has no points, which
the plot area then divides its own width by — the C1 arithmetic exactly. It was right about the
arithmetic and wrong that it was reachable: an empty chart threw `NullReferenceException` long
before it got there, which is the more immediate defect and the one that had been hiding the other.

Three lazily-created collections, all the same shape as `Chart.XAxis` — created by a property on
first read, and then read through the field, which is null until someone has asked:

- `Chart.SeriesCollection`, read as `chart.seriesCollection` by `ChartFrame.GetChartRenderer`, so a
  chart nothing was added to threw before any renderer ran. The C1 fix had carried the same pattern
  into both `CalculateXAxisValues` methods.
- `Series.Elements`, read as `sri.series.seriesElements` at thirteen sites, so a chart holding a
  series that holds nothing threw in `InitSeries`.

All sixteen reads now go through the property. Behind them the arithmetic was reachable after all,
so both plot area renderers leave the matrix as the identity when there is nothing to plot against
it:

```csharp
if (xMax <= xMin || yMax <= yMin)
{
  cri.plotAreaRendererInfo.matrix = new XMatrix();
  return;
}
```

That guard tests the span, and review afterwards found that `ColumnLikePlotAreaRenderer` did not
divide by one: it scaled the width by `xMax` where the bar renderer scales by `xMax - xMin`, so
the guard and the division were asking different questions. The two agree only because the category
axis fixes its minimum at zero — `CalculateXAxisValues` assigns it, and unlike the value axis it
never takes one from the `Axis` object — which put the correctness of a guard here at the mercy of
a constant assigned in another file.

The division was the half that was wrong, so the division is what changed:
`plotAreaBox.Width / (xMax - xMin)`. The translate on the line above has already moved `xMin` to the
origin, so the span is the distance actually being fitted across the plot area, and the two
renderers now scale the same axis the same way. Nothing moves on any page today, `xMin` being zero.
The first draft guarded `xMax <= 0` instead and left the division alone; that stopped the infinity
but not the mis-scaling behind it, and it would have refused to draw a legitimate category range
lying entirely below zero.

One more sat behind that: `LinePlotAreaRenderer` handed a zero-length point array to `DrawLines`,
which answers `ArgumentException: The point array must contain 2 or more points`. A series with
fewer than two points is now skipped — a line through one point is not a line.

An empty chart of any of the eight types now draws its axes and nothing inside them.

## What is still open

None of these is a defect. They are gaps the fixes above put in plain view, and each would be a
change to what a chart looks like rather than to whether it can be drawn.

- **`Chart.DisplayBlanksAs` is read by nothing.** The property is public, the `BlankType` enum
  offers `NotPlotted`, `Interpolated` and `Zero`, and no renderer consults it. C2 made the default
  work; the other two kinds are unimplemented. `LinePlotAreaRenderer` carries a TODO saying so.
- **A line or area chart plots a blank as zero**, which is `BlankType.Zero` rather than the default.
  Both renderers already did that for a NaN value, and an area is a closed shape that needs a point
  for every category to close over, so leaving them alone was the smaller claim. Implementing
  `DisplayBlanksAs` is where this belongs.
- **An axis title cannot be aligned across its own axis**, because the strip reserved for it is its
  own size. See C6.
- **Rasterization.** Nothing in the test project renders a chart to an image; it references no
  backend and needs neither Ghostscript nor ImageMagick, which is what lets it run anywhere. A chart
  is asserted through the operators it wrote.
- **Line, area and pie geometry.** Where the wedges and line segments themselves land is not
  asserted; those renderers were not among the ten and would want a path reader rather than a
  rectangle reader.
- **Legends.** `LegendRenderer` and its three subclasses draw an entry per series with a swatch
  beside it. One test reaches the swatch incidentally; the docking, wrapping and entry layout are
  untested.
