# Spec — the open mode enforced where it is named

What making `PdfDocumentOpenMode` mean something at the point it is read covers, and what it
deliberately leaves out.

| item | what | status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `CanModify` reading the open mode again, as `!IsReadOnly` | done |
| 2 | Every refusal naming both the mode used and the modes wanted | done |
| 3 | Twelve dead guards made live, one removed, the thirteenth fork deleted | done |
| 4 | `InformationOnly` decided: removed from the enum, its number left vacant | done |
| 5 | The matrix of four modes against seventeen operations, pinned | done |
| 6 | `PdfPages.Remove` and `RemoveAt`, which were never guarded at all | done |

## What shipped

`CanModify` is `!IsReadOnly`. The ten guards on `PdfDocument` and `PdfPages` that were meant to
refuse now refuse, `PSSR.CannotModify` became a method taking the operation and the open mode, and
`XGraphics.FromPdfPage` and `PdfPageResizer` were routed through the same message so that a caller
who tries to draw and a caller who tries to add a page are told the same thing about the mode they
chose. `OpenModeEnforcementTests` is the matrix.

Two of the twelve were decided the other way, which is the part worth carrying:

**`Close` lost its guard rather than gaining teeth.** Closing a document is not changing it, and
`Close` writes only when the document was constructed on an output stream — which a document read by
`PdfReader` never is. There was nothing there for a read-only document to be refused.

**`PageCount`'s second way of counting is gone.** The fork labelled *"PdfOpenMode is
InformationOnly"* read `/Count` off the page tree root instead of walking the tree, and no document
had ever taken it. Making the guard live would have taken it for the first time, in a branch nothing
had ever exercised — and needlessly, because every open mode reads the file in full and builds the
page tree.

**`InformationOnly` was removed from the enum.** Implementing the partial read it named would have
changed the reader, which this spec rules out, so the choice was between a mode documented as a
synonym for `ReadOnly` and no mode at all — and a mode whose whole content is "it is really that
other one" is the same offer-that-does-nothing the dead guards were.

What removing it costs is that the compiler inlines an enum constant at the call site, so an
assembly compiled against `InformationOnly` goes on passing `3` however the source changes. **The
four remaining members therefore state their values and 3 is left vacant.** Letting `Append` slide
from 4 to 3 to close the gap would have silently redirected every such caller into the removed
mode's place — the exact failure the enum's own note has warned about since `Append` was added. An
old assembly passing 3 now hands over a value the enum does not define, and `IsReadOnly` answers
anything that is not `Modify` or `Append` the same way, so that caller keeps the behaviour it always
had. `ThreeStaysVacantWhereInformationOnlyWas` and `ADocumentOpenedWithTheVacantNumberIsReadOnly`
pin both halves.

Two things this spec asked for and did not need. Restoring the guards refused nothing the demos, the
suite or the corpus rely on: 3,941 tests, 37 demos and all six conformance documents pass unchanged,
so the change never met the first real caller the Further Notes anticipated. And `SaveIncremental`'s
refusal was already correct; it only gained the mode in its message, and a separate sentence for a
document that was created rather than opened, where naming the mode would have named the enum's
default and been a lie.

**`PdfPages.Remove` and `RemoveAt` were never guarded at all**, which is why neither was among the
twelve: removing a page from a read-only document silently succeeded and wrote nothing, the same
defect one method along. Both now refuse, both with "removing a page". Neither has a `PdfDocument`
counterpart, so `document.Pages` is the only way to reach them and the matrix covers them there.

## Problem Statement

`PdfReader.Open` takes a `PdfDocumentOpenMode`, and CLAUDE.md warns that picking the wrong one is *"a
common cause of 'this API does nothing'"*. The reason is in the source:

`PdfDocument.CanModify` returns `true` unconditionally, with the real check commented out beside it —
`//get {return _state == DocumentState.Created || _state == DocumentState.Modifyable;}`. Twelve
operations guard on it: `Close`, both `Save` overloads, the setters of `Version`, `PageLayout` and
`PageMode`, and — through `PdfPages.EnsureCanModify` — `Insert`, `Place`, `Import`, `Duplicate`,
`MovePage` and `InsertRange`. Every one of them reads exactly like the mode check a reader expects to
find, and enforces nothing at all. A thirteenth site is not a guard but a fork: the `PageCount`
getter has a whole second way of counting pages *"PdfOpenMode is InformationOnly"* that no document
has ever taken.

Those twelve are written at seven places rather than twelve. `docs/specs/pdfdocument-thin-forwarders.md`
has landed, so the six page-tree operations share one `EnsureCanModify` in `PdfPages`, and
`PdfDocument.AddPage`, `InsertPage`, `PlacePage`, `ImportPage`, `DuplicatePage` and `MovePage` no
longer repeat it — they are one-line forwarders into the methods that do. That is where the repair
below has to be made for all six, and it now also covers a caller who reaches the page tree through
`document.Pages` rather than through those forwarders.

What actually refuses lives in four other modules and uses a different property. `IsReadOnly` — which
is real, and is `_openMode != Modify && _openMode != Append` — is read by `XGraphics` when creating a
drawing surface and by `PdfPageResizer`. `PdfPages.Import` has its own check. `PdfSigner` and
`SaveIncremental` require `Append`, the latter by way of whether the original bytes were kept.

So a caller who opens `ReadOnly` and calls `AddPage` is not refused. They get a page. What they do
not get is any of it written, or they get a failure much later from a module three layers away that
mentions a different concept. The constraint has no locality: it is named in one place, enforced in
four others, and absent from the rest.

There is a fifth mode, `InformationOnly`, whose declaration carries `// TODO: not yet implemented`.

The wider shape is that five modes grant five different, partly disjoint interfaces over one
implementation type, and all eighteen `Open` overloads return the same `PdfDocument`. `Import` alone
permits `ImportPage`; only `Append` permits `SaveIncremental`; only `Modify` and `Append` permit
`XGraphics.FromPdfPage`. None of that survives into the type, so the compiler can never say what the
doc comment says.

## Solution

Make the guard that names the constraint be the guard that enforces it.

`CanModify` reads the open mode again. Every refusal says which mode the caller needed and which
they have. The twelve guarded operations become live, and any that turn out to be wrong about what
they were guarding are corrected or removed rather than left reading as protection they do not
provide.

This is deliberately the smaller of the two available changes. The larger one — giving each mode its
own type so the compiler enforces the constraint — is set out under Out of Scope and is not proposed
here.

## User Stories

1. As a developer opening a document read-only, I want `AddPage` to refuse, so that I find out at
   the call rather than by wondering why my output has one page.
2. As a developer, I want the refusal to tell me which open mode I need, so that I can fix it without
   reading the source.
3. As a developer, I want the refusal to tell me which mode I used, so that I can see the mistake.
4. As a developer opening `Import`, I want extraction to work and modification to refuse, so that the
   mode means what it is documented to mean.
5. As a developer opening `Modify`, I want everything that works today to keep working.
6. As a developer using `Append`, I want incremental save to keep working and a full `Save` to be
   the deliberate act it already is.
7. As a developer, I want a consistent concept: one question — may I change this document — asked one
   way.
8. As a maintainer, I want a guard in the source to be a guard in the binary, so that reading the
   code tells the truth.
9. As a maintainer, I want a guard that turns out to be unnecessary removed rather than left
   dormant, so that the next reader is not misled the same way.
10. As a maintainer, I want `InformationOnly` either implemented or removed, so that the enum does
    not offer a mode that does nothing.
11. As a maintainer, I want the demos and the conformance corpus checked against the restored guards
    before release, so that the change is known to be safe on our own output.
12. As a consumer upgrading, I want a release note naming this, so that code that relied on the
    absent guard is not surprised.
13. As a consumer, I want the change to be a refusal rather than a silent behaviour difference, so
    that if I am affected I know immediately.

## Implementation Decisions

**This is a behaviour change, not a refactor, and must be released as one.** Turning the guard on
will refuse code that runs today. Any caller who opened `ReadOnly` or `Import` and then modified the
document was getting a result that was never going to be written correctly, so refusing them is the
repair — but it is still a break, and it belongs behind a release note that names the affected
methods.

**`CanModify` and `IsReadOnly` must become one question.** Two properties answering "may this change"
with different logic is how the current split survived. `IsReadOnly` is the one that works and is
public; `CanModify` is internal. The internal one should be defined in terms of the public one, and
the four modules that check `IsReadOnly` directly should keep doing so.

**Each of the twelve guarded operations is a decision.** They are not uniformly correct. Some guard
operations that genuinely require modification; `Close` may not be one of them, since closing a
read-only document is reasonable. Every one is either confirmed, corrected to a different mode
requirement, or removed. Leaving one dormant reproduces the problem this spec exists to fix. The six
page-tree operations are decided one at a time even though they are written at one place: sharing
`EnsureCanModify` makes the guard one edit, not one judgment.

**Refusals name both modes.** *"This document was opened `ReadOnly` and adding a page needs
`Modify`."* The existing `PSSR.CannotModify` string says neither and should be replaced or
parameterised.

**`Append` is not a lesser `Modify`.** Its own doc comment already warns that `Modify` cannot be used
for incremental save and that the reason is easy to miss. `IsReadOnly` already treats `Append` as
modifiable and that stays.

**`InformationOnly` gets decided, not deferred again.** Either it behaves as `ReadOnly` with a
narrower promise, or it is removed from the enum. A mode marked "not yet implemented" that silently
behaves like something else is the same class of problem as the dead guard.

**Nothing here changes the reader.** `PdfReader.Open` already records the mode correctly. The defect
is entirely on the consuming side.

**Run the corpus and the demos before believing it.** `ConformanceCorpus` and `SampleApp` between
them open documents in every mode the library offers — `Assemble`, `Import`, `Extract`, `Revise`,
`Signing`, `Inspect`, `PageResize` — and are the cheapest available evidence that the restored guards
do not refuse something legitimate.

## Testing Decisions

**A good test here opens a document in a mode and asserts what it may do.** The observable behaviour
is which calls succeed and which throw, and what the exception says. That is a small, complete
matrix and it should be written as one.

**Modules under test.** `PdfDocument` for the guarded operations, and the four modules that already
enforce — `XGraphics`, `PdfPages`, `PdfPageResizer`, `PdfSigner` — for the ones they own.

**Prior art to follow rather than reinvent.** `PdfSharpCore.Test/IO/` holds the reader and mode
tests; `PageResizeTests` already exercises a document opened for modification and is a model for
arranging one. `PdfSharpCore.Test/Helpers/PdfHelper.cs` builds documents to open. `RawPdf.cs` builds
byte-exact files where the document must be malformed or minimal.

**The matrix worth pinning.** For each of the five modes, assert the outcome of: `AddPage`,
`InsertPage`, `ImportPage`, `MovePage`, `DuplicatePage`, `XGraphics.FromPdfPage`, `Save`,
`SaveIncremental`, `Close`. Most cells are one line. This matrix is the durable artefact — it is what
makes the mode a specified thing rather than an emergent one, and it is what a future change to any
of those methods will be measured against. Add `document.Pages.Add` and `document.Pages.InsertRange`
to it: they are guarded now, they have no `PdfDocument` counterpart to reach them by, and the second
never was.

**Assert on the message, not only the type.** The point of the change is that the refusal names the
mode. A test that only checks `InvalidOperationException` would pass against the unhelpful message
this spec exists to replace.

**The demo smoke tests are the integration proof.**
`PdfSharpCore.Test/Demos/DemoSmokeTests.cs` fails the build when a demo throws or changes its page
count, and the demos exercise real open-mode usage across `Assemble`, `Extract`, `Revise` and
`Signing`. If the restored guards are wrong, that is where it shows.

**veraPDF still gates.** `./verapdf-check.ps1` builds its corpus by opening and saving documents, so
a wrongly restored guard would show there too.

## Out of Scope

- **Giving each mode its own type.** The larger and better answer: `Open` returning a type whose
  interface is what that mode permits, so the compiler enforces it. It is a breaking API change
  across eighteen overloads and every consumer, and it should not be smuggled in behind a guard
  repair. Worth its own proposal.
- **The `DocumentState` enum the commented-out code refers to.** Whether that concept should return
  is a separate question from whether the open mode should be honoured.
- **`PdfDocument`'s width.** Eight page methods that were a guard plus one call into `PdfPages`, and
  two nested helpers — `ImageInfo` and `DocumentHandle` — that fail the deletion test in opposite
  directions. Real, and not this: it became
  `docs/specs/pdfdocument-thin-forwarders.md`, which has landed, and is why the guard now has one
  home per page-tree operation rather than two.
- **`PdfPage`'s six responsibilities**, including the copying `TrimMargins` setter. Also real, also
  not this.
- **The simple-type immutability rule.** `PdfItem` carries it as a bare comment, `PdfString` breaks
  it and says so. Unenforced invariant, different problem.
- **Making `Parser` testable without a `PdfDocument`.** Worth doing; unrelated.

## Further Notes

This is the smallest diff of the strong candidates and the one most likely to be argued about,
because the current behaviour is permissive and permissive behaviour has users. The argument for
doing it anyway is that the permissiveness is not a decision anybody made — it is a commented-out
line — and the twelve guards that read as protection are actively misleading to anyone reading the
code to find out what the mode does.

If the matrix in the testing section turns out to refuse something the demos or the corpus rely on,
that is not a reason to abandon the change. It is the change finding its first real caller, and the
question then is whether that caller was right.
