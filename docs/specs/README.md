# Spec index

Every design note in this directory, and whether the work it describes has landed.

Each spec carries its own status table, and **that table is the authority** — this file summarises
it. A spec here is one of three things: a *proposal* written before the work, a *retrospective*
written after it against what actually shipped, or a *findings* note recording what testing or an
investigation turned up. All three are tracked the same way, because what a reader wants to know
first is the same in each case: is this the code as it stands, or the code as somebody hoped it
would be?

**36 done · 5 in progress · 16 not started · 57 total.**

Read the relevant spec before extending that feature area.

## Done

The spec describes the code as it is. Items marked *deliberately not done* inside these are scope
decisions, not outstanding work.

## In progress

Part of the spec has landed. Each entry says what is left.

- [ ] [crap-coverage-backlog.md](crap-coverage-backlog.md) — the CRAP backlog, worked in batches. Batches 0–18 are done: 237 methods over the threshold down to 172, 109 never-executed down to 71. Batches 15–18 leave a handful of named items for later, and the list wants re-measuring.
- [ ] [digital-signatures.md](digital-signatures.md) — signing a document (G5). Items 1–6 built, including `IPdfSigner`, PAdES B-B, certifying signatures and verification. **Open:** PAdES B-T timestamps, B-LT/LTV, enforcing what a `/DocMDP` level permits. Trust stores and revocation are deliberately out.
- [ ] [generated-serialization.md](generated-serialization.md) — generating the flat attribute writes inside the DOM's `Serialize`. **Step 1 of 6 shipped** — the `MDG007` diagnostic exists and fires. Steps 2–6 have not started: no `SerializeValues` is emitted anywhere.
- [ ] [interactive-layer-gaps.md](interactive-layer-gaps.md) — gaps found writing the Forms, Annotations and Outline demos. Five fixed, one partly. **Open:** authoring a form through the typed AcroForm API, `PdfAcroFieldFlags.Comb`, `PdfInternals.CreateIndirectObject<T>()` returning null, bookmarks and links not surviving page import.
- [ ] [pdfkit-text-parity.md](pdfkit-text-parity.md) — text feature parity against PDFKit's 25 `doc.text()` options. **Sections A–E are built.** Section F is not, and is deliberately left: it is a shaping engine, and bigger than everything above it put together.

## Not started

Written, argued, and not yet acted on.

- [ ] [charting-renderer-seam.md](charting-renderer-seam.md) — asking a charting renderer what it computed. Sequenced after `axis-renderer-duplication.md`, which has landed.
- [ ] [conformance-completeness.md](conformance-completeness.md) — the four PDF/A rules nothing checks, and the `A` levels nothing can claim (G4 tail).
- [ ] [conformance-preconditions.md](conformance-preconditions.md) — a conformance claim that refuses at the point of the claim rather than at save.
- [ ] [dom-property-seams.md](dom-property-seams.md) — the DOM's remaining property seams driven off the value descriptor. Sequenced behind `generated-serialization.md`.
- [ ] [font-seam-contracts.md](font-seam-contracts.md) — stating the lifecycle each of the five global font seams promises.
- [ ] [layout-api-decision.md](layout-api-decision.md) — **a decision note, not a proposal** (G8). Build a constraint-solver layout model, or make the flow model pleasanter? The largest strategic call in the gap analysis, and unmade. Nothing should be built here until it is answered.
- [ ] [legacy-collections-migration.md](legacy-collections-migration.md) — `ArrayList` and `Hashtable` replaced by generic collections. Still 19 files using one and 7 the other; `ParagraphFormatInfo.lineInfos` still boxes a struct per line of every paragraph.
- [ ] [nested-lists.md](nested-lists.md) — a list inside a list, which the DOM cannot currently say (G2 tail).
- [ ] [nice-to-have-inventory.md](nice-to-have-inventory.md) — the ten deferred features, each with the seam it would be tested at. An inventory, not a proposal.
- [ ] [open-mode-enforcement.md](open-mode-enforcement.md) — `PdfDocumentOpenMode` enforced where it is named. `CanModify` is still hardcoded `true`; twelve guarded operations at seven places are waiting on it.
- [ ] [shared-character-scanner.md](shared-character-scanner.md) — one character scanner shared between the document lexer, the content lexer and the DDL scanner.
- [ ] [shared-visual-order.md](shared-visual-order.md) — the leftmost-position rule written once instead of in both layout engines.
- [ ] [signature-lifetime.md](signature-lifetime.md) — PAdES B-T and B-LT, and enforcing what a `/DocMDP` level permits (G5 tail).
- [ ] [structure-tagger-interface.md](structure-tagger-interface.md) — separating "my parent" from "the element I just opened" in the tagger.
- [ ] [tabbed-bidirectional-lines.md](tabbed-bidirectional-lines.md) — reordering a right-to-left line that contains a tab (G3 tail).
- [ ] [tagged-text-extraction.md](tagged-text-extraction.md) — extraction that reads the marked content the tagger writes (G7 tail).

## The competitive gap analysis

Eight gaps were named. Seven are closed or substantially closed; the eighth is a decision nobody has
made.

| gap | spec | status |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | [cross-reference-streams.md](cross-reference-streams.md) | done |
| G2 | [tagged-pdf-accessibility.md](tagged-pdf-accessibility.md) | done |
| G3 | [text-shaping-and-bidi.md](text-shaping-and-bidi.md) | done |
| G4 | [pdf-a-conformance.md](pdf-a-conformance.md) | done |
| G5 | [digital-signatures.md](digital-signatures.md) | core done, PAdES B-T and LTV open |
| G6 | [incremental-update-save.md](incremental-update-save.md) | done |
| G7 | [text-extraction.md](text-extraction.md) | done |
| G8 | [layout-api-decision.md](layout-api-decision.md) | **undecided** |

Five of the seven closed gaps have a tail that is specified but not built — G2 nested lists, G3 tabbed
right-to-left lines, G4 the unchecked rules and the `A` levels, G5 signature lifetime, G7 tagged
extraction — each under **Not started** above. The second tier of that analysis, ten features none of
which is built, is inventoried in [nice-to-have-inventory.md](nice-to-have-inventory.md).

## Keeping this file honest

- A spec's own status table is what decides its entry here. Change that table first.
- Move a spec between sections in the same commit that lands the work, not afterwards.
- A new spec starts under **Not started** with a one-line summary of what it proposes.
- "Done" means every item is either shipped or recorded as a deliberate exclusion. An item that is
  merely deferred keeps the spec under **In progress**, with the remainder named in its entry above.
