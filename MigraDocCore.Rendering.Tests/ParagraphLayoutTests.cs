/// <summary>
///   How paragraphs are set against one another down a page, and what happens when there are more
///   of them than the page holds.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///   Promoted from MigraDoc 1.32's TestLayout, which set two paragraphs with a space after the
///   first and a larger space before the second and saved the result to look at, and then set a
///   thousand of them to see them break across pages.
///
///   The two-paragraph arrangement turns out to have been asking a real question. Two adjacent
///   spaces do not add up: the larger of them wins and the smaller is not applied at all, so the
///   two centimetres after the first paragraph are worth nothing beside the three before the
///   second. Nothing said so, and the harness could not have told you either way.
///
///   The thousand is scaled down. It was a stress run whose value was in seeing pages break, and
///   two hundred paragraphs break pages just as well in a fraction of the time.
/// </remarks>
