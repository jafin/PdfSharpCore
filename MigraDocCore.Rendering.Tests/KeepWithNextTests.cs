///   Deciding that means the formatter looks past the element it is placing to the ones after it,
///   and asks whether they would fit in what is left — a heading followed by a table that will not
///   fit has to go over with the table rather than end the page on its own.

///   asking to be kept with the next one cannot empty a page between them. The tests below measure
///   the page rather than assert an absolute line count, since how many lines a page holds depends
///   on the font metrics and this project pins those precisely so that it can.
