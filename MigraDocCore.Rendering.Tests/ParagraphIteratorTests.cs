/// <summary>
///   The renderer lays a paragraph out by walking its leaves - the runs of text, the symbols, the
///   line breaks - rather than its tree, because a formatted run is a container of leaves and not
///   a thing that is drawn. It walks forwards to fill a line and backwards to break one further
///   back when what it placed did not fit, so the two directions have to agree about what the
///   leaves are and about their order.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///   Promoted from MigraDoc 1.32's TestParagraphIterator, which built the two walks into strings
///   and returned them for a person to read. The walks are the part worth keeping; the reading is
///   what an assertion is for.
///
///   Worth pinning now rather than later: the iterator holds its position in an
///   <c>ArrayList</c> of boxed indices, and <c>docs/specs/legacy-collections-migration.md</c> has
///   it down for migration. These tests are what that change will be checked against.
