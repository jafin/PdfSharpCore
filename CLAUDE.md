# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```powershell
dotnet build PdfSharpCore.slnx           # SDK is pinned to 10.0.100 by global.json
dotnet test                              # whole suite, both test target frameworks
dotnet test -f net10.0                   # one framework; the test project targets net8.0;net10.0
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~CLexerTests"                  # one class
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~CLexerTests.ScanNextToken"    # one test
./ci-build.ps1                           # what CI builds: clean + Release build
```

CI (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) runs on Linux only, builds with `ci-build.ps1`, installs
Ghostscript, then runs `dotnet test` with coverlet/opencover coverage.

There is no lint or format step in the build or in CI.

**Judge a test run by its exit code, not by the word `Passed`.** Every rasterization on Windows
runs Ghostscript *inside* the test host, and its way of giving up is to end the process — so a
document it will not draw reads as `Test host process crashed`, exit 1, no failing test, and a
`Passed!` line printed anyway with a total short of what was discovered. Reading the tail of
`dotnet test` reports such a run as green. A run whose total is below what `dotnet test
--list-tests` finds did not pass; it stopped. `--blame-crash` then names the test that never
finished, and **whether that name repeats is the diagnosis**: the same one twice is a document to go
and look at, and it settled this twice. A different name every run is the machine rather than the
suite — the third episode crashed five runs in eight at a tenth of the memory of the first two, was
reproduced on a commit predating everything suspected, and then stopped for good with nothing
changed. Re-run before believing it. See `docs/specs/test-host-crash-investigation.md`.

A lexer or parser change can hang the test host rather than fail it. Tests that scan malformed
input carry `[Fact(Timeout = …)]`, which xUnit honours only on `async` tests — hence the
`Task.Run` wrappers in `CLexerTests`.

```

Five test projects, and which one a new test belongs in is worth a moment. `PdfSharpCore.Test`
is the broad one and the default. `MigraDocCore.DocumentObjectModel.Generators.Tests` drives the
DOM's source generator through `CSharpGeneratorDriver`. `MigraDocCore.Rendering.Tests` covers
MigraDoc's own layout — paragraphs, tables, fields, the paragraph iterator — and its tagged output,
and deliberately rasterizes nothing, so it needs neither Ghostscript nor ImageMagick. It links four
content-stream readers out of `PdfSharpCore.Test/Helpers` rather than keeping copies; edit those in
place and both projects get the change.

`PdfSharpCore.Charting.Tests` covers the charting renderers — axis scales, category axes, plot
areas, data labels, axis titles — and links three of those same readers. Every renderer in the
package is `internal` and this repository carries no `InternalsVisibleTo`, so they are reached the
only way a caller can reach them: a `Chart` handed to a `ChartFrame`, drawn, saved, reopened, and
read back out of the content stream. The three helpers under `Helpers/` are what make that legible —
`Drawn` puts a chart on a page, `PaintedRectangles` reads the `re` operators the columns and bars
are drawn with, and `ShownText` turns the Identity-H glyph runs back into text through the font's
own `/ToUnicode` map, so a test can assert `"0.0"` rather than a glyph number. Like the DOM's tests
it references no backend: a chart draws lines, rectangles, wedges and strings, so of the three
static seams it reads only `GlobalFontSettings.FontResolver`.

Writing those tests turned up seven defects, all reachable through public API and all since fixed:
`docs/specs/charting-renderer-findings.md` sets out each with the code, the fix and the test that
pins it. Two are worth carrying in your head, because both were one renderer having a guard its
twin lacked, and the pairs are still near-copies of each other. **The category axis renderers are
copies of one another** — `HorizontalXAxisRenderer` and `VerticalXAxisRenderer`, and likewise the
horizontal and vertical Y renderers — so a change to one nearly always belongs in the other.
**A blank is a null**, both in a series (`Series.AddBlank`) and in a category series
(`XSeries.AddBlank`); read a point's value through `PointRendererInfo.Value`, which answers `NaN`
for one, rather than through `point.value`, which throws.

`MigraDocCore.DocumentObjectModel.Tests` covers the DOM itself — `Unit`, page sizes, the chart
object model, MDDDL reading and writing, and the flattening visitors. It references the DOM **and
nothing else**: no renderer, and so no backend, no Ghostscript and no font files. The one
qualification is `NamedFontsOnly.cs`, a module initializer serving a font *name*, because building
a `Document` builds its standard styles and the Normal style asks the resolver what the default
font is called. It resolves no face and throws if asked to, which is the line saying a test needing
a real font belongs in `MigraDocCore.Rendering.Tests`. Note that `PdfSharpCore.Test/Dom/` also
covers the DOM, from the other side: the value model, colours, styles and the generated property
machinery. The two do not overlap.

`SampleApp` is the demonstration app: `dotnet run --project SampleApp -- list` says what it covers,
`… -- run` writes one PDF per demo into `SampleApp/output` and prints the source that drew each. Its
demos are covered by `PdfSharpCore.Test/Demos/DemoSmokeTests.cs`, so a demo that throws or changes
its page count fails the build.

Three rules there are load-bearing rather than stylistic, all explained in
`docs/specs/demonstration-app.md`: **a demo never registers a backend** (the smoke test runs demos
inside a test host that has already installed `PinnedFontResolver`, and
`GlobalFontSettings.FontResolver` throws once a font has been used — which is also why
`Backends.EnsureRegistered` rather than a demo sets `TextShaper` and `FontFallback`, and why no
demo's page count may depend on either); **its fonts, images and sources are embedded resources, not content files** (a referenced
project's content items do not reach the referencing project's output directory); and **a demo whose
output `Save` would destroy overrides `PdfDemo.Save`** — `Save` rewrites a file from the object
model, which invalidates every signature and discards every earlier revision, so `Signing` writes
through `PdfSigner.Sign` and `Revise` through `SaveIncremental`.

`SampleApp` references `PdfSharpCore.HarfBuzz` and `PdfSharpCore.Signing` for one demo each. Neither
is a dependency the library forces on a consumer, and both are written out in the project file so
that what those two demos cost is visible.

The core package deliberately carries no imaging or font dependency. All five seams are static, and
the first three throw a descriptive `InvalidOperationException` when read unset:

- `GlobalFontSettings.FontResolver` — an `IFontResolver`; backends supply `SkiaFontResolver` /
  `ImageSharpFontResolver`, both built on `Utils/FontResolverBase`. Must be set before any font is
  created: the setter throws once one has been.
- `ImageSource.ImageSourceImpl` — an `ImageSource`; backends supply `SkiaImageSource` /
  `ImageSharpImageSource`. Must be set before any image is loaded.
- `GlobalFontSettings.GlyphOutlineProvider` — an `IGlyphOutlineProvider`; backends supply
  `SkiaGlyphOutlineProvider` / `ImageSharpGlyphOutlineProvider`. Wanted by `XGraphicsPath.AddString`
  and nothing else, so it can be set, replaced or cleared at any time. A provider takes its font
  bytes **through** `FontResolver` rather than resolving a family itself, or the two seams will
  disagree about which face a family means.
- `GlobalFontSettings.TextShaper` — an `ITextShaper`; `PdfSharpCore.HarfBuzz` supplies
  `HarfBuzzTextShaper`. **One of the two seams whose unset state is not an error**: reading it
  answers null, and then every path does what this library always did, one character to one `cmap`
  lookup to one glyph. It can be set, replaced or cleared at any time, and a shaper that returns
  null for a run has declined it rather than failed, so the unshaped result stands.
- `GlobalFontSettings.FontFallback` — an `IFontFallback`, which says which families to try for a
  character the chosen face has no glyph for. **The other seam whose unset state is not an error**:
  null means a missing glyph stays `.notdef`, exactly as it always was. `FontFallbackList` is the
  whole of what most documents need. Reading it answers the registered `FontResolver` when that
  resolver implements `IFontFallback` too, so a resolver that already knows what is installed need
  not be registered twice. **Nothing about coverage is looked at while it is null** — that is what
  keeps the common path free.

Note the asymmetry between the last two and `FontResolver`: a new member on `IFontResolver` would
break every consumer who has written one, and netstandard2.1 rules out a default interface method
Unity's runtime would accept. That is why capability keeps arriving as a seam of its own rather
than as a wider resolver, and it is the answer to "why is this not just on `IFontResolver`".

`PdfSharpCore.HarfBuzz` is a package of its own rather than a class in a backend, because shaping
must not oblige a consumer to pick an imaging backend — `PdfSharpCore.ImageSharp` is pinned to
SixLabors.Fonts 1.0.1 for licence reasons and cannot shape for itself. It takes `HarfBuzzSharp`
alone, not `SkiaSharp.HarfBuzz`.

Everything that turns a character into a glyph goes through the internal `Fonts/TextShaping` — both
`FontHelper.MeasureString` and `XGraphicsPdfRenderer.DrawString`, so that the glyphs measured are the
glyphs drawn. A shaper is handed a `ShapingFont`, not an `XFont`, because the typeface and font source
are internal; it carries the already-resolved face and its bytes, so a shaper cannot disagree with the
renderer about which file a family means. Advances are in **font design units**, read against
`ShapedRun.UnitsPerEm`.

Both of those call `TextShaping.ShapeText`, not `TextShaping.Shape`: a *string* is not a run, and
`ShapeText` is where it is cut into runs — one direction and one script each — and each is shaped on
its own terms. It answers a `ShapedText`, a list of `ShapedSegment` in **visual order**. Drawing them
back to back is all that reordering takes, because PDF has no notion of direction: a show-text
operator paints glyphs at the pen and moves the pen along. **A string of characters all below
`U+02B0` skips itemisation entirely** — everything there is Latin or Common and left to right, so
there can only be one run — which is what keeps the common path free of a bidi resolution and a
string copy, and what kept every existing golden image exactly where it was.

**`ShapedGlyph.Cluster` is load-bearing.** It is the character↔glyph map, and three separate things
read it. `CMapInfo.AddShapedRun` — which *replaces* `AddChars` on the Unicode path, because the
characters' own glyphs are not the ones drawn — records both the glyphs to embed and give widths to
and what each of them stands for. `PdfToUnicodeMap` writes a one-character glyph as a `bfrange` and a
several-character one as a `bfchar`, because a `bfrange` destination is a single code and cannot say
that one glyph swallowed two characters. And `XGraphicsPdfRenderer.ShowTextOperators` reads it to put
a word spacing after the space's *last* glyph rather than at the space's character index.

A glyph a shaper wants displaced is written as `-dx … +dx` inside a `TJ` array for the horizontal and
with `Ts` for the vertical — nothing else in the renderer writes `Ts`, so it is zero on entry and is
put back. A run needing no displacement is still a plain `Tj`, which is what keeps every existing
document byte-identical.

## Bidi and script itemisation

`PdfSharpCore/Text/` holds the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm (UAX #9) and script itemisation
(UAX #24). Pure text processing, no font and no backend, which is why it is in the core rather than
behind the shaping seam. `TextItemizer.Itemize` is the entry point worth knowing: it hands back runs
that are each one direction **and** one script, in the order they are drawn — which is exactly what
`ITextShaper.Shape` takes. `TextShaping.ShapeText` is its one caller inside the library, and through
it every `DrawString` and every `MeasureString` reorders.

**A joining control is inside a run, not between two.** U+200C and U+200D are bidi class `BN` and so
removed by rule X9, which is right for ordering and was wrong for shaping — they are exactly the
characters that tell the face how the letters either side of them join. `BidiResult.Runs` therefore
reaches over one rather than breaking at it, and `TextShaping.Unshaped` skips it explicitly so that
no glyph is drawn for a character that is zero width by definition. Both halves are load-bearing, and
it is only those two characters, not the whole of `BN`: `UnicodeProperties.IsJoiningControl` says
which, and widening it would change what existing documents look like.

**Reordering is not shaping, and does not need a shaper.** `TextShaping.Unshaped` reverses a
right-to-left run, because `ShapedRun` promises visual order and the renderer relies on it — so a
consumer who takes no HarfBuzz dependency still gets Hebrew and Arabic the right way round, unjoined.
That is the older half of the complaint in `empira/PDFsharp-1.5#144` and it is fixed in the core.

A layout engine that places each word itself has to order them, and two do. `XTextFormatter` hands
whole lines to `DrawString` for every alignment but one, so only justifying needed changing.
`MigraDocCore.Rendering/ParagraphRenderer.cs` draws one show-text operator per leaf and needed the
most: **it walks each line twice**, once with `probing` set to learn how wide every leaf is without
drawing anything, then again for real with each leaf placed where the bidirectional algorithm says.

Both order a word by **the leftmost position any of its characters ends up at**, not by its first
character — a right-to-left word's first character is its rightmost. That is also what keeps an
English phrase inside a Hebrew sentence in its own order, where reversing the line turns it round.

Two things about the MigraDoc pass are load-bearing. **The second walk is still in the order the
leaves were written** — only the x changes — so the marked content stays in reading order, which
is what a structure tree is for; `TheMarksStayInTheOrderTheTextIsRead` asserts both orders at once.
And **a line with a tab in it is left alone**, because a tab's width is consumed from a list built
during formatting and cannot be walked twice. While reordering, the underline, strikethrough and
hyperlink rules are drawn per leaf rather than per stretch, or one rectangle would run backwards
across the line.

`ParagraphFormat.TextDirection`, `XTextFormatter.TextDirection` and `XStringFormat.TextDirection`
all take `BidiParagraphDirection` — one type, not three saying the same thing.
`Drawing/Layout/BidirectionalLayoutTests.cs` and `MigraDocCore.Rendering.Tests/BidirectionalParagraphTests.cs`
pin the two engines.

The character property tables are **generated and checked in** — `tools/UnicodeTableGenerator`,
deliberately outside `PdfSharpCore.slnx` so the build and CI never see it, run by hand on a Unicode
bump. Read its README before touching them; the short version is that `DerivedBidiClass.txt`'s
`@missing` lines live inside comments, are not all `Left_To_Right`, and are what make unassigned code
points in the Hebrew and Arabic blocks default to `R` and `AL`.

Everything is pinned to **Unicode 17.0.0**, and three things move together on a bump: the generated
tables, the gzipped conformance suites in `PdfSharpCore.Test/Assets/Unicode/`, and the version
asserted in `UnicodePropertyTests`. Bumping one without the others tests one Unicode against
another's expectations.

`BidiConformanceTests` runs `BidiTest.txt` and `BidiCharacterTest.txt` in full — 861,948 cases, about
two seconds — as one `[Fact]` per suite rather than a theory per case, because half a million xUnit
cases is a denial of service on the runner rather than a test run. If a change to the algorithm
breaks something, that is what says so, and it reports the failing case in UAX #9's own rule terms.

`docs/specs/text-shaping-and-bidi.md` has the rest, including what is still missing: font fallback,
the measurement paths, and the DOM property.

`PdfSharpCore.Signing` is the one package that does **not** multi-target `netstandard2.1`, and the
one that carries a dependency the core deliberately refuses: `System.Security.Cryptography.Pkcs`,
which ships in the runtime but not in the reference pack and so needs a version-matched
`PackageReference` per leg. The core's own `Pdf.Signatures` namespace holds all the PDF machinery —
the placeholder, the byte range, the patching — and no cryptography at all, behind the `IPdfSigner`
seam. `docs/specs/digital-signatures.md` says why that split is where it is.

`ImageSource` is a trap for the eye: the file is `PdfSharpCore/Drawing/ImageSource.cs` and it ships
in the **PdfSharpCore** assembly, but its namespace is
`MigraDocCore.DocumentObjectModel.MigraDoc.DocumentObjectModel.Shapes`. Registering it needs that
`using`, from code that otherwise has nothing to do with MigraDoc.

## PDF object model and IO

`PdfItem` is the root of everything. Types derived from `PdfItem` but not from `PdfObject` are
simple types and **must be immutable** — `PdfName`, `PdfString`, `PdfInteger` and friends. `PdfObject`
adds identity and indirect references; `PdfDictionary`/`PdfArray` compose them.

`PdfReader.Open` takes a `PdfDocumentOpenMode` that decides far more than access: `Modify` reads
everything into memory and lets pages be inserted or deleted but not extracted, `Import` allows
extraction but no modification, `ReadOnly` preserves the original internal structure. Picking the
wrong one is a common cause of "this API does nothing".

**Strings and names are byte strings, one char per byte.** `Lexer` reads with
`(char)stream.ReadByte()`, `PdfEncoders.RawEncoding` converts back, and `PdfWriter` asserts
`ch < 256` on the way out. Nothing in the name path re-decodes to Unicode, so a name written in a
legacy code page keeps its bytes across a read/write round trip. Do not "fix" this by decoding to
UTF-8 — it breaks the writer. `LexerNameEncodingTests` pins the invariant down.

There are two independent lexers, and a change to one usually belongs in the other:

- `Pdf.IO/Lexer.cs` + `Parser.cs` — the document body, reading from a `Stream`.
- `Pdf.Content/CLexer.cs` + `CParser.cs` — content streams, reading from a `byte[]`, with its own
  `Chars` and `CSymbol`. It is the older and rougher of the two; the document lexer usually has the
  guard the content lexer is missing.

## Drawing

`XGraphics` is the drawing surface and holds an `IXGraphicsRenderer`; `XGraphicsPdfRenderer`
(`Drawing.Pdf/`) is the only implementation and emits content-stream operators. MigraDoc renders
through the same surface, so a layout fix lands in `MigraDocCore.Rendering` and a drawing fix in
`Drawing.Pdf`.

Fonts are always embedded, with no setting to disable it. TrueType outlines are subsetted;
PostScript (CFF) outlines cannot be and embed whole. A weight or slant with no font file is
simulated by stroking or skewing.

## Tagged output

**MigraDoc tags what it draws, and that is the default** — `PdfDocumentRenderer.TagContent` is `true`,
so every document it renders carries a structure tree. Two consequences bite immediately.
`PdfPage.Resize` refuses a tagged document, so code that renders through MigraDoc and then resizes has
to set `TagContent = false`. And a renderer that draws anything must say what it is drawing:
`Renderer.Tagger` hands out the scopes, content goes in `Tagger.Block`/`Container`/`Marks` and
decoration in `Tagger.Artifact`, and **anything inside an artifact scope is not tagged at all** — the
tagger counts depth and refuses, because a running head drawn by the paragraph renderer would otherwise
appear in the tree as a paragraph.

That refusal has a consequence worth knowing before you write a renderer: **`Tagger.Current` is not
"the element I just opened".** A refused scope pushes nothing, so `Current` still names what was
current before it — and a renderer that opened a scope and then wrote alternate text onto `Current`
wrote it onto an unrelated element. Take the element from the `out` parameter of `Tagger.Block` /
`Tagger.Container` instead, and treat null as "not tagged".

`docs/specs/tagged-pdf-accessibility.md` has the rest, including why an element is keyed by its DOM
object rather than built per render pass.

## Multi-targeting

Every shipped package targets `netstandard2.1;net8.0;net10.0`. `netstandard2.1` exists **for Unity**,
whose scripting runtime cannot consume a `net8.0` assembly — check with the maintainer before
dropping it. Two consequences:

- `Directory.Build.props` sets `LangVersion=latest` for every leg, or the netstandard2.1 leg would
  compile shared source as C# 8. This unlocks *syntax* only. Anything needing a BCL type
  netstandard2.1 lacks (`IsExternalInit` for records and `init`, `RequiredMemberAttribute`,
  `InlineArray`) still fails as a missing-predefined-type error, and has to be polyfilled.
- `PdfSharpCore/!internal/` and `MigraDocCore.DocumentObjectModel/CompileFixes/` hold those
  polyfills behind `#if !NET5_0_OR_GREATER`. They look like dead code on a modern-target glance and
  are not. Both copies exist because each is `internal` with no `InternalsVisibleTo`.

## Tests

`TestBackendSetup` is a `[ModuleInitializer]` that registers the Skia backend and Ghostscript for
the whole assembly — individual tests do not set up backends.

`PinnedFontResolver` serves Liberation Sans (Arial metrics) from `Assets/Fonts` instead of the
machine's fonts, because glyph widths decide where a line wraps and therefore what a layout
assertion sees. A test needing its own font calls `PinnedFontResolver.Register` rather than
swapping the resolver out from under everything else running beside it.

`[GoldenImageFact]` marks tests comparing against checked-in reference images; it self-skips with a
reason when Ghostscript cannot rasterize on the current machine. Anything that rasterizes belongs
to `[Collection(RasterizingCollection.Name)]` — ImageMagick drives one in-process Ghostscript, so a
second concurrent rasterization silently falls back to an executable that may not be installed.

Ghostscript comes from `Ghostscript.NativeAssets` on Windows. Linux and macOS shell out to the
system `gs`, so those tests need `apt-get install ghostscript` / `brew install ghostscript` locally.

Assertions use **AwesomeAssertions**, a FluentAssertions fork — the API is the same, the `using` is
not.

## Conventions

Commit subjects describe the behaviour change in plain prose, in the imperative, without a
conventional-commit prefix: *"Read a hex string by the digits in it rather than by what follows
them"*, *"Follow a composite glyph down to the glyphs it is really drawn from"*. Bodies explain what
was wrong and why the new way is right. Pure housekeeping does use `chore:` / `refactor:`.

Sources use file-scoped namespaces. `.editorconfig` enforces a final newline — a bulk conversion
once stripped it from 725 files, and every later diff touching the end of a file showed the damage.

`docs/specs/` holds design notes for this fork's features, each tied to an upstream issue number,
recording what was built and what was deliberately left out. Read the relevant one before extending
that feature area.
