# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

This file starts at the entry below. Changes before that point are recorded only in the git history.


## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Characters above the basic multilingual plane are drawn.** The font reader now reads the `cmap`
  format 12 subtable, which is the only one that reaches past U+FFFF. An emoji used to be three
  failures at once: a surrogate pair drew `.notdef` *twice* because each half was looked up
  separately, coverage could not answer for an astral character, and so font fallback could not be
  offered one either. All three went through `OpenTypeDescriptor.CharCodeToGlyphIndex` and all three
  are fixed together — including fallback, so a face that has the character can now rescue one that
  does not.

  A code point inside the basic multilingual plane is still answered out of format 4 even where the
  face carries both subtables. The two agree in practice, but that is not a reason to change which
  glyph an existing document draws.

- **Bold simulation is decided per face rather than once per string.** A family with no bold file has
  its boldness stroked and widened on; that is a property of the face, and a string that fell back is
  drawn out of more than one. A fallback with a real bold used to be stroked and widened anyway.
  Measuring agrees, so a line is laid out at the width the page draws.

- **Headings claiming PDF/UA-1 may not skip a level** (ISO 14289-1 7.4.2). `/H1` followed by `/H3` is
  refused at save time, naming the level that was skipped. Coming back up any distance is not a skip.
  From MigraDoc the level is `ParagraphFormat.OutlineLevel`, which is what a heading style sets.

- **`Footnote.Identifier`** — the `/ID` a note is known by in a tagged document, for when it has to
  mean something outside the document. Unset, the renderer generates `note1`, `note2` in citation
  order as before.

- **`XTextFormatter` flows text around things the caller puts in the block.** Give it obstacles and
  the lines whose band they stand in are narrowed around them, on either side, in any column.

  ```csharp
  var quote = new XRect(140, 150, 220, 108);        // where you drew it, in the block's own frame
  formatter.Obstacles.Add(new RectangleObstacle(quote, padding: 14));
  formatter.Columns = 2;
  formatter.DrawString(copy, font, XBrushes.Black, block);
  ```

  The geometry is asked one question per line — *at this band, which runs are free?* — and answers
  with a set of them, so an obstacle standing clear of both edges honestly reports a run either side.
  **The line is laid out in the widest run and the others are left empty.** That is a decision rather
  than a limitation: filling several would make one logical line span them, which justification,
  alignment and truncation all assume never happens. MigraDoc's `WrapStyle` settled the same way.

  `RectangleObstacle` is the only `IFlowObstacle` that ships. An ellipse, a polygon or an
  `XGraphicsPath` is a new implementation of that interface rather than a redesign — flatten,
  intersect the band, pair the crossings — but none is written, so text does not follow a silhouette
  yet. **Padding belongs to the obstacle**, not the formatter, because how much air a thing wants
  around it is a fact about that thing; it holds text off vertically as well as horizontally, so a
  line that would otherwise clear an image by a hair is pushed past it instead.

  Obstacles are positioned **relative to the layout rectangle and unrotated**. Layout is worked out
  in that frame and `Rotation` turns the drawing surface afterwards, so an obstacle given in it turns
  with the text. Supplying one while `Rotation` is set throws rather than guessing which frame was
  meant — rotate the `XGraphics` instead and leave `Rotation` alone.

  A band with nothing left in it moves the line down past what blocks it and tries again, rather than
  drawing across it. The drop cap is now an obstacle like any other, which is why a cap reserves room
  in the first column only: not a test on the column index any more, just where it stands.

  Not covered: contour wrapping, more than one run per line, per-side padding, and obstacles that
  push the block's top down — an obstacle narrows lines and never moves or grows the block.

- **Text flows beside a shape in MigraDoc.** `WrapFormat.Style` takes four new values — `Left`,
  `Right`, `Largest` and `Both` — and a shape carrying one of them stands in the area the following
  elements are laid out in rather than pushing them down the page.

  ```csharp
  var frame = section.AddTextFrame();
  frame.Width = Unit.FromCentimeter(4.5);
  frame.Height = Unit.FromCentimeter(4);
  frame.RelativeVertical = RelativeVertical.Paragraph;   // what makes it float at all
  frame.RelativeHorizontal = RelativeHorizontal.Margin;
  frame.Left = ShapePosition.Left;
  frame.WrapFormat.Style = WrapStyle.Right;              // the text runs down its right
  ```

  `Left` and `Right` name **the side the text occupies**, not the side the shape sits on. The
  opposite reading is equally natural and a caller who guesses wrong gets a page that looks
  deliberate and is backwards, so it is worth reading twice. `Largest` gives each line whichever
  side of the shape has more room. `Both` asks for either side; a line is given one span rather than
  every span, so it lays out as `Largest` does today, and the two are kept apart because they say
  different things and would part company if that changed.

  All four `WrapFormat` distances now mean something for a side-wrapped shape. `DistanceLeft` and
  `DistanceRight` hold the text off horizontally as they always claimed to; `DistanceTop` and
  `DistanceBottom` grow the obstacle vertically, so a line whose box would otherwise clear the shape
  by a hair is pushed past it instead. For a `TopBottom` shape they remain the element's own margins,
  unchanged.

  Not covered: contour wrapping (the shape is tested as a box), a shape spanning a page break, and
  wrapping beside a table — a shape too tall for the area left to it falls back to `TopBottom`
  rather than producing an obstacle that outlives its area. `XTextFormatter` is a drawing surface
  with no notion of a shape and is unaffected.

  **A document using one of the new styles cannot be read by an older version of this library.** The
  values are appended, so `TopBottom`, `None` and `Through` keep the numbers they had and an older
  document reads unchanged; but MDDDL writes the style by name, and an older reader meeting
  `Style = Left` refuses the file rather than falling back to a layout the document did not ask for.

  A document that asks for no side wrap lays out byte for byte as it did, pinned across ten
  documents and fourteen pages.

- `XTextFormatter.DropCap` — an initial letter set into the opening lines of a block, with those
  lines shortened to leave room for it.

  ```csharp
  var formatter = new XTextFormatter(gfx)
  {
      DropCap = new XDropCap(new XFont("Liberation Serif", 10, XFontStyle.Bold), lines: 3),
  };
  formatter.DrawString(text, body, XBrushes.Black, area);
  ```

  The depth is given in **lines**, not as a font size: lines are what the surrounding text is
  measured in, and a size implies a depth that is almost never a whole number of them. The formatter
  takes the first character of the text, scales it so its head is level with the head of the letter
  beside it and its foot rests on the baseline of the last line it is set into, reserves the room
  and narrows the lines that stand against it.

  The head is level by **cap height** rather than by the top of the line's box. A line's box reaches
  an ascent above its baseline and the letters in it reach only a cap height, the difference being
  the room the face keeps for accents; a cap hung from the box stands clear of the text it is set
  into by that much, magnified by the size of the cap. A face that declares no cap height in its
  OS/2 table gets the ascent, as it does everywhere else in the library.

  Placed by the glyph's **ink** where `GlobalFontSettings.GlyphOutlineProvider` is registered, so the
  cap sits flush with the margin rather than a side bearing's width inside it. Where no provider is
  registered it is placed by the advance instead — a drop cap does not require a backend seam.

  Behind it, `XTextFormatter` now works out the measure available to each line from where that line
  sits, rather than once for the whole block. A block with nothing narrowing it lays out exactly as
  it did, which is pinned byte for byte across the seventeen ways the formatter can be asked to lay
  text out.

- `PdfPage.Resize` and `PdfDocument.ResizePages` — change the size, shape or orientation of a page
  that already has content on it, in the document that holds it. The content is scaled into the new
  size rather than cropped by it, and the annotations of the page and the link destinations that
  point at it move with it.

  ```csharp
  page.Resize(PageSize.A5);                                  // fit the whole page in, centred
  page.Resize(PageSize.A4, PageOrientation.Landscape);       // reshape and refit
  document.ResizePages(PageSize.A4, PageOrientation.Portrait,
      new PageResizeOptions { AutoRotate = true });          // normalise a mixed batch
  ```

  `PageResizeOptions` carries the fit mode (`Fit`, `Fill`, `Stretch`, `None`), a nine-way
  alignment, a margin, `AutoRotate`, and switches for the annotation and destination passes.
  `PageResizeOptions.Default` and `PageResizeOptions.Crop` are the two common intents.

  Refused on a document that is encrypted, signed or tagged, rather than producing one whose
  signature no longer verifies or whose structure tree no longer describes the page.

  `PdfPage.Rotate` is unchanged and is still the free, lossless way to turn a page over without
  touching its content. See `docs/specs/page-resize.md`.

- 27 predefined page sizes that `PageSize` did not name: `A7`–`A10`, `TwoA0` and `FourA0` (the
  DIN 476 oversizes 2A0 and 4A0, spelled out because a C# identifier cannot begin with a digit),
  `B6`–`B10`, the whole ISO 269 `C0`–`C10` envelope series, and the untrimmed `SRA0`–`SRA4` stock.

  ```csharp
  page.Size = PageSize.C5;    // the envelope an A5 sheet goes into unfolded
  page.Size = PageSize.A7;
  ```

  With these, `PageSize` covers every size in the
  [pdfkit paper-size table](https://pdfkit.org/docs/paper_sizes.html), which it previously met only
  in part. Each is rounded to whole points as the existing entries are.

- 57 page formats that MigraDoc's `PageFormat` did not name. It knew twelve — A0–A6, B5, Letter,
  Legal, Ledger and P11x17 — and everything else had to be set as a `PageWidth` and a `PageHeight`.
  It now names every size `PdfSharpCore.PageSize` does: `A7`–`A10`, `TwoA0` and `FourA0`, the rest
  of the B series, the `C0`–`C10` envelopes, `RA0`–`RA5`, `SRA0`–`SRA4`, `JISB5`, and the North
  American and traditional sheets from `Tabloid` and `Executive` through to `QuadDemy`.

  ```csharp
  section.PageSetup.PageFormat = PageFormat.C5;
  ```

  The two enumerations stay separate types — MigraDoc records the format by name in MDDDL, and its
  sizes are held in the unit that defines them, whole millimetres for the ISO and DIN sheets, rather
  than rounded to whole points. The names now agree, which is what made them confusable.

  `P11x17` is kept alongside the `Tabloid` that names the same sheet, because MDDDL files hold it.

- Text state on `XStringFormat`, honoured by both drawing and measurement: `CharacterSpacing`,
  `WordSpacing`, `HorizontalScaling`, `TextRise` and `ObliqueAngle`, written as the PDF `Tc`, `Tw`,
  `Tz` and `Ts` operators and as a skewed text matrix.

  ```csharp
  var format = XStringFormats.Default;
  format.CharacterSpacing = 2;      // points after every glyph
  format.WordSpacing = 4;           // points after every space, on top of that
  format.HorizontalScaling = 80;    // percent
  format.ObliqueAngle = 12;         // degrees, leaning right
  gfx.DrawString("spaced out", font, XBrushes.Black, 20, 40, format);
  ```

  `Tw` counts the single-byte code 32 and is inert for a font embedded as Identity-H, which is what
  `GlobalFontSettings.DefaultFontEncoding` gives every `XFont` built without options of its own.
  Those have their words spaced out with a `TJ` array instead, so the same setting produces the same
  page whichever encoding the font uses.

- Stroked text. `DrawString` takes an `XPen` beside its `XBrush`, in the six shapes the brush-only
  overloads already came in. A brush alone fills the glyphs, a pen alone outlines them, both does
  both, and neither throws — as `DrawRectangle` has always answered the same question.

  ```csharp
  gfx.DrawString("outlined", font, new XPen(XColors.Black, 0.6), null, 20, 40);
  ```

- `XStringFormat.Underline` and `.Strikeout`, in the six shapes MigraDoc has always had —
  `Single`, `Words`, `Dotted`, `Dash`, `DotDash`, `DotDotDash` — plus `DecorationColor`, which draws
  the rule in a colour of its own. Setting them on the font through `XFontStyle` still works and
  still means one solid rule.

- `XLineAlignment.Hanging`, `.Ideographic` and `.SvgMiddle`, the three baselines the HTML canvas has
  and this did not. They are measured against the text rather than against the layout rectangle,
  which is what distinguishes them from `Near` and `Far`.

- `XTextFormatter` grew the paragraph options its own TODO list had named for years: `LineBreak`,
  `Indent`, `IndentAllLines`, `ParagraphGap`, `LineGap`, `Ellipsis`, `Rotation`, and `Columns` with
  `ColumnGap` for text that flows down one column and on into the next.

  ```csharp
  var formatter = new XTextFormatter(gfx)
  {
      Columns = 2, ColumnGap = 18,
      Indent = 12, ParagraphGap = 6,
      Ellipsis = XTextFormatter.DefaultEllipsis,
  };
  formatter.DrawString(text, font, XBrushes.Black, new XRect(40, 40, 500, 300));
  ```

- Named destinations. `PdfDocument.NamedDestinations` names pages and places on them, written into
  the catalog as a `/Names /Dests` name tree; `Resolve` reads one back out of a document, which
  until now only the import machinery could do. `PdfPage.AddNamedLink` and
  `PdfLinkAnnotation.CreateNamedLink` follow a name.

  ```csharp
  document.NamedDestinations.Add("chapter-3", document.Pages[7], top: 500);
  page.AddNamedLink(rect, "chapter-3");
  ```

  A name outlives the page it stands for. Insert a page in front of page 7 and every link to page 7
  is wrong; every link to `chapter-3` is still right.

- `XGraphics.AddWebLink`, `AddDocumentLink`, `AddNamedLink` and `AddNamedDestination`, which take
  the coordinates the drawing methods take. An annotation is placed in default page space, measured
  up from the bottom left, and everything drawn is placed in world space, measured down from the top
  left — the conversion was the whole of what stood between drawing a piece of text and linking it.

- `PdfPage.MarkMargins` and `PdfPage.DrawCropMarks` — the room on the sheet outside the bleed, and
  the eight standard crop marks drawn into it. A page with a trim margin gets both without asking:
  the allowance is 5mm on each edge, and the marks are drawn when the document is saved.

  ```csharp
  page.Size = PageSize.A5;
  page.TrimMargins.All = XUnit.FromMillimeter(3);   // the bleed, as before
  page.MarkMargins.All = XUnit.FromMillimeter(5);   // the room for marks; this is the default
  page.MarkMargins.All = 0;                         // no room, and so no marks
  ```

  Two marks meet at each corner of the trimmed page, one on each of its edges, and each runs
  outward from the bleed to the edge of the sheet. None crosses the bleed, so none can be mistaken
  for artwork or land on the part of the page that survives the cut.

- A `Bleed` demo in the demonstration app: a photograph drawn from negative coordinates so that it
  runs off three edges of the page, with the trim edge marked and the five page boxes listed. See
  `docs/specs/demonstration-app.md`.

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** `ImageSource.IImageSource.SaveAsPdfBitmap(MemoryStream)` is replaced by
  `PixelBuffer GetPixels()`, and `XImage.AsBitmap()` by `XImage.GetPixels()`. Anyone who has written
  an implementation of that interface has to change the member; anyone who called `AsBitmap()` for
  the bytes gets pixels instead of a BMP file.

  ```diff
  - void SaveAsPdfBitmap(MemoryStream ms)
  + PixelBuffer GetPixels()
  ```

  What the member handed over was a hand-built 32bpp bottom-up BMP that nothing outside this library
  ever read: `PdfImage` parsed the magic number, the declared length, the width, the height, the
  plane count, the bit count and the compression field back out at fixed byte offsets, and every one
  of those fields was written moments earlier by the other half of the same call. The two ends of it
  also flipped the rows in opposite directions, so the file was bottom-up and the pixels that came
  out of it were the top-down ones that went in — correct by two mistakes cancelling.

  `PixelBuffer` says the one thing that was ever really being passed: `Width`, `Height` and a
  `ReadOnlyMemory<byte>` of tightly packed, top-down, straight-alpha **BGRA**, four bytes per pixel
  and no stride padding. There is no format tag, because there is one format. Grayscale and CMYK
  stay unsupported exactly as they were — the `components`/`bits`/`hasAlpha` parameters that used to
  suggest otherwise were called from one place with one set of values, and the grayscale branch
  under them could never run.

  Both backends produce the same bytes for the same image, as they did before. `PdfSharpCore.Skia`
  no longer writes a `BITMAPFILEHEADER` and `BITMAPINFOHEADER` by hand for a format SkiaSharp
  refuses to encode, and `PdfSharpCore.ImageSharp` no longer drives `BmpEncoder`'s general
  conversion — it performs the R/B reorder itself through ImageSharp's own bulk pixel conversion,
  where before it was borrowing one from an encoder as a side effect of BMP's on-disk byte order.

- **BREAKING:** `IFontFallback.FamiliesFor` takes an `int` code point where it took a `char`.
  Anyone who has written an implementation of that interface has to change the signature; the body
  usually needs no change, because a `char` widens to an `int` and the values below U+10000 are the
  same numbers.

  ```diff
  - public IEnumerable<string> FamiliesFor(char character, bool isBold, bool isItalic)
  + public IEnumerable<string> FamiliesFor(int codePoint, bool isBold, bool isItalic)
  ```

  The reason is the point of the change rather than a detail of it: neither half of a surrogate pair
  is a character and no `cmap` maps one, so a `char`-shaped question about an astral character could
  only ever be answered "nobody". The interface's own documentation used to say so. `FontFallbackList`
  and everything else in this repository are updated.

- **A tagged document no longer nests one marked-content sequence inside another.** A sequence
  carrying an MCID is a content item of exactly one structure element, so nesting two made the inner
  glyphs belong to both — a footnote mark was claimed by its `/Reference` and by the `/P` around it,
  with nothing to say which a reader should announce. The outer sequence is now suspended and resumed
  instead, which an element supports because it may own several content items. Content streams of
  tagged documents differ accordingly; the structure tree does not.

- **BREAKING:** a page with `PdfPage.TrimMargins` set is saved with different page boxes. The three
  areas now nest as the PDF specification describes them — `/MediaBox` ⊇ `/BleedBox` ⊇ `/TrimBox` —
  where `/BleedBox` used to be written equal to `/MediaBox`, leaving nowhere on the sheet for a crop
  mark to go. The sheet is correspondingly larger, by the new `MarkMargins` on each edge.

  Nothing changes for a page that sets no trim margin, which is almost every page: the whole feature
  stays invisible to a document that does not ask for it.

  `page.MarkMargins.All = 0` reproduces exactly the boxes this library wrote before, for a caller
  whose downstream tooling expects them.

- **BREAKING:** `IXGraphicsRenderer.DrawString` takes an `XPen` before its `XBrush`, so that text
  can be outlined as well as filled. The interface is public; anything implementing it outside this
  repository has to add the parameter. `XGraphicsPdfRenderer` is the only implementation here.

  Migration is `DrawString(s, font, brush, rect, format)` →
  `DrawString(s, font, null, brush, rect, format)`.

- `XGraphics.MeasureString(text, font, stringFormat)` now answers through the format it is given.
  It took one and passed `XStringFormats.Default` on instead, which nothing noticed while a format
  held only alignment — where a string sits does not change how wide it is. Every text state
  property added above does change how wide it is, and a width measured without them is what decides
  where a line wraps.


- **BREAKING:** MigraDoc's `PageFormat.B5` measured 182 mm × 257 mm, which is the **JIS** B5 sheet,
  not the ISO one. It was the only B format the enumeration had, so nothing sat beside it to
  contradict it; now that `B0`–`B4` and `B6`–`B10` are named, a JIS sheet in the middle of an ISO
  series would be a sheet that is not half of the one above it. `B5` is now ISO B5, 176 mm × 250 mm.

  A section set to `PageFormat.B5` therefore reflows: it loses 6 mm of width and 7 mm of height, and
  text that fitted a line may no longer. To keep the sheet you had, use the new `PageFormat.JISB5`,
  which measures exactly what `B5` used to.

- **BREAKING:** the `PdfPage.Size`, `PdfPage.Width` and `PdfPage.Height` setters now throw
  `InvalidOperationException` when the page already has content on it. Before this change they
  wrote a new media box and nothing else, which cropped the page rather than resizing it —
  silently, with no exception and no warning. Setting them on a page with no content, which is the
  usual `document.AddPage(); page.Size = PageSize.A4;`, is unchanged.

  Migration is `page.Size = X` → `page.Resize(X)`.

  If you were relying on the crop, note what it actually did: it wrote the new box at the origin,
  and the origin of a PDF page is its **bottom-left** corner, so it kept the foot of the page and
  cropped the heading away. `page.Resize(X, PageOrientation.Portrait, PageResizeOptions.Crop)`
  crops from the **top left** instead, which is almost certainly what was wanted. To reproduce the
  old anchoring exactly, ask for `PageAlignment.BottomLeft`.

- `XGraphicsPath.AddString` produces a real path. Both overloads used to report through
  `DiagnosticsHelper` and return, so the path stayed empty and whatever was being written vanished
  from the page — no exception, no warning.

  ```csharp
  GlobalFontSettings.GlyphOutlineProvider = new SkiaGlyphOutlineProvider();   // once

  var path = new XGraphicsPath();
  path.AddString("HEADLINE", new XFontFamily("Arial"), XFontStyle.Bold, 96, box, XStringFormats.TopLeft);
  gfx.DrawPath(new XLinearGradientBrush(box, XColors.Red, XColors.Blue, XLinearGradientMode.Horizontal), path);
  ```

  The glyphs are placed by the same arithmetic `DrawString` places them by, so a path agrees with
  the text it stands in for. **To stroke text you still do not need a path** — `DrawString` takes a
  pen as well as a brush. Come here for what that cannot do: fill glyphs with a gradient, clip an
  image to their shapes, or widen them as geometry.

- `IGlyphOutlineProvider` and `GlobalFontSettings.GlyphOutlineProvider` — a third static seam beside
  `GlobalFontSettings.FontResolver` and `ImageSource.ImageSourceImpl`, supplying the glyph geometry
  `AddString` needs. `SkiaGlyphOutlineProvider` and `ImageSharpGlyphOutlineProvider` ship with the
  two backends; unset, it throws an `InvalidOperationException` naming the property and the packages,
  exactly as the other two seams do.

  It exists so that the core package keeps carrying no font dependency: reading contours out of a
  font means a `glyf` decoder for TrueType and a Type 2 charstring interpreter for PostScript
  outlines. Both backends already ship a library that does both, so PostScript (CFF) families work
  from the first day rather than producing an empty path.

  It is a separate interface rather than a member on `IFontResolver`, which every consumer with a
  resolver of their own implements and which a new member would break. A provider reads its font
  bytes *through* the registered resolver, so the two cannot disagree about which face a family means.

- `XLinearGradientBrush` and `XRadialGradientBrush` honour the alpha of their colours. A gradient
  between a transparent colour and an opaque one used to paint a flat opaque band over whatever it
  was meant to veil, because a shading dictionary carries colour and no alpha anywhere.

  ```csharp
  var scrim = new XLinearGradientBrush(band,
      XColor.FromArgb(0, 0, 0, 0), XColors.Black, XLinearGradientMode.Vertical);
  gfx.DrawRectangle(scrim, band);   // now fades out as well as across
  ```

  Where either colour's alpha is below 1, the shading pattern is painted under a luminosity soft
  mask built from the same axis or circles, the same extent and the same interpolation, so the
  alpha ramps exactly as the colour does. The mask is taken off again before anything else is
  drawn, and two gradients on one page each carry their own. A gradient whose colours are both
  opaque takes none of this: no soft mask, no extended graphics state, no transparency group.

- `XLineAlignment.BaseLine` accepts a layout rectangle of any height. It threw
  `InvalidOperationException` unless the height was exactly `0`, which made `XStringFormats.Default`
  — the format a caller reaches for when not thinking about formats, and `BaseLineLeft` — throw on
  `DrawString(text, font, brush, rect)`, the most natural overload there is.

  ```csharp
  gfx.DrawString("Anchored", font, XBrushes.Black, new XRect(20, 60, 300, 20));  // used to throw
  ```

  The baseline sits on the rectangle's top edge and the height is ignored, which is what the
  placement arithmetic always did — nothing but the guard read the height for this alignment. Code
  passing a zero-height rectangle is unaffected. `XGraphicsPath.AddString` carried a second copy of
  the same guard and has lost it too.

- **BREAKING (narrow):** a MigraDoc table row marked with `HeadingFormat` which cannot be part of the
  heading now throws `InvalidOperationException` while the document is being formatted, naming the
  row. The heading a table repeats onto its later pages is the run of marked rows beginning at the
  first row; a row marked outside that run was discarded without a word.

  ```csharp
  table.Rows[0].HeadingFormat = true;   // a title band
  table.Rows[1].HeadingFormat = true;   // the column names — mark both, or neither repeats
  ```

  The rule has not changed, only its silence. Every document this throws for is a document that
  asked for a repeating heading and did not get one, so it was already producing the wrong output;
  the message says which row to mark or unmark. It is raised during formatting, before any page is
  written, so a caller never receives half a document because of it.

### Fixed

- **A drop cap too wide for its column threw the text outside the column.** The cap is scaled to its
  own depth and nothing holds its width to the measure, so a deep cap set into a narrow column can
  leave the lines beside it no room at all. `XTextFormatter` had no way to say that: a measure
  starting at or past its own right limit read to the layout loop as a very narrow line rather than
  as no line, and the loop places the first block of a line whether it fits or not — which is right
  for a word wider than its measure and wrong here. The result was one word per line, drawn past the
  right edge of the column, for as many lines as the cap was deep, with nothing thrown.

  A line whose band has no room in it is now moved down to the foot of what blocks it and laid out
  there, so the text begins below the cap instead of beside it. The move always advances by at least
  one line, so an obstruction level with the band it blocks cannot stall the loop; where there is no
  room below either, the text is dropped exactly as text that runs past the last column is.

  Text that fits beside its cap is unaffected, and output with no cap at all is unchanged.

- **A trimmed page grew every time it was saved.** `PrepareForSave` derived the sheet by adding the
  trim margins to `PdfPage.Width`, and `Width` reads the media box that `PrepareForSave` had just
  overwritten with the sheet. So saving a document to a stream and then to a file — an ordinary
  thing to do — produced two files of different sizes, the second larger by another sheet's worth of
  margin on every edge.

  The size the page was asked for is now remembered before the media box is grown into the sheet.
  The same fix makes `Width` and `Height` go on reporting the page after it has been saved, where
  they used to start reporting the sheet, which moved every right-aligned and bottom-aligned thing
  measured off them.

- **An uneven trim margin put `/TrimBox` on the wrong edges.** `PrepareForSave` inset Y1 by the
  *top* margin and Y2 by the *bottom* one, and Y1 is the bottom edge of a PDF rectangle — so the two
  were swapped, and the trim box disagreed with the drawing origin, which was placed correctly. A
  page whose top and bottom margins match, which is the usual case and the case the original
  numbers were copied from, could not show the difference.

  Both this and the growth above were found by writing the first tests `TrimMargins` has ever had.

- **No gradient this library produced was visible in a conformant reader.** The interpolation
  function of an RGB shading was given a fourth value — the colour's alpha, which is not a colour
  component — so the function was wider than the `/DeviceRGB` space it fed. That is malformed, and
  Ghostscript answers it by painting nothing at all: a page with a gradient on it came out blank
  where the gradient was.

  ```text
  /ColorSpace /DeviceRGB
  /Function << /C0 [1 0 0 1] /C1 [0 0 1 1] ... >>   before, four values for three components
  /Function << /C0 [1 0 0]   /C1 [0 0 1]   ... >>   after
  ```

  Alpha now goes where alpha belongs, into the soft mask described above. CMYK gradients are
  unaffected — four values is what that colour space has always required. Nothing else about how a
  gradient is written changes: the content stream, the shading geometry and the pattern matrices
  are byte for byte what they were.

- Bold simulation measured multi-line text too wide. The widening it adds was counted over the whole
  string and charged to the widest line, so a simulated-bold string of three lines measured as
  though every character of all three sat on one of them.

- A line feed was charged a character spacing for a glyph it never drew.

- `PageSize.Executive` measured 540 × 720 points (7.5 × 10 inch), which is not the Executive sheet.
  It is 7.25 × 10.5 inch and now converts to 522 × 756 points — the size its own documentation
  always claimed, and the one ISO, `System.Drawing.Printing.PaperKind.Executive` and every other
  library give. A page asking for `PageSize.Executive` changes size as a result; a page whose width
  and height were set in points does not.

- A page-level transparency group (`/Group << /S /Transparency /CS /DeviceRGB >>`) was written onto
  every page of every saved document, whether or not anything on the page painted with transparency
  and whether or not the page arrived with one. Opening a document and saving it again was enough to
  add one to all of its pages.

  A transparency group is not inert: it tells a reader to composite the page as a unit against the
  backdrop, which can change how overprint and non-RGB content render, and `/CS /DeviceRGB` was
  imposed on pages whose content is not RGB.

  A page is now given a group only where it needs one: where something drawn on it uses an alpha
  below 1, or where an image or form placed on it paints with transparency of its own — a soft mask,
  a blend mode that reads what is underneath, or a transparency group of its own. A page whose
  content is opaque throughout, and an imported page that came in without a group, are written
  without one. A page that came in **with** a group keeps the one it had, as before.

  Documents that PdfSharpCore produced before this change are unaffected on the way in; they keep
  the group they were written with. The one visible difference is on the way out: opaque pages get
  smaller and no longer claim a colour space they do not use.

- Drawing a page of another document with `XPdfForm` dropped that page's transparency group. A group
  describes the content it wraps, and the content was being moved into a form XObject while the
  group was left behind in the document it came from, so the imported page arrived composited
  against the wrong backdrop. It is now imported with the rest of the page. The equivalent path for
  a page of the *same* document, which a page resize uses, already moved the group across.

- A PDF null was read as though it were the thing it stands in for. `/SMask null` in a graphics state
  or an image counted as a soft mask, which put a transparency group back onto pages whose content is
  opaque; `/Group null` on an imported page was cast to a dictionary, which threw rather than drew;
  and an indirect null anywhere in an imported page — `/SMask 6 0 R` with `null` in object six — hit
  a debug assertion while the page was being imported. A null now reads as the absent entry it is.

### Removed

- **BREAKING:** `PdfDocumentOptions.EnableCcittCompressionForBilevelImages`. The CCITT encoder this
  option gated was unreachable, so the option had no effect on any document — setting it changed
  nothing. Code that sets it will no longer compile; delete the assignment. No PDF that this library
  produces changes as a result.
- The CCITT Group 3/4 fax encoder (`PdfImage.FaxEncode.cs`) — `DoFaxEncoding`,
  `DoFaxEncodingGroup4`, and their `BitReader`/`BitWriter` helpers. Its only two call sites were the
  unreachable code removed below. Reading `/CCITTFaxDecode` streams from existing PDFs is unaffected;
  that is a separate path in `Pdf.Filters/Filtering.cs`.
- `PdfImage.ReadIndexedMemoryBitmap`, which had no callers. It could not have worked if called: it
  never filled its `MemoryStream`, so its `streamLength > 0` guard skipped the whole method body.
- The unused image importer subsystem in `PdfSharpCore/Drawing.Internal/` — `ImageImporter`,
  `ImageImporterBmp`, `ImageImporterJpeg`, `ImageImporterRoot`, `IImageImporter`, and the
  `StreamReaderHelper`, `ImportedImage`, `ImageInformation`, `ImagePrivateData` and `ImageData`
  types it defined. Nothing constructed it; `ImageImporter.GetImageImporter` had no callers and
  `ImageImporterBmp.PrepareImage` was an unimplemented stub. Every type was `internal` and the
  assembly has no `InternalsVisibleTo`, so nothing outside could reach them either.

Image handling continues to go through `PdfImage.ReadTrueColorMemoryBitmap`, which was already the
only live path. All 2,617 removed lines were unreachable before removal.
