/// <summary>
///   A literal string beginning with a byte order mark is UTF-16, two bytes to the character. One
///   byte short of that is a string whose last character is missing half of itself, and the
///   document lexer reads the missing byte as a zero.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///   The reading was there already and had no test. What it also had was a
///   <c>DebugBreak.Break()</c> beside it, left over from the "TODO What does the PDF Reference say
///   about this case?" written above it - so a caller opening a slightly corrupt document under a
///   debugger was stopped inside the library at a breakpoint nobody had set. The break is gone and
///   the reading is pinned here instead.
///
///   The break itself cannot be asserted against: it fired only when a debugger was attached, and
///   nothing is attached to a test host. What these assert is the reading it was standing beside.
///
///   The missing byte is read as a zero because that is the reading the reference does specify for
///   the same shortfall in a hexadecimal string, which <see cref="LexerHexStringTests"/> covers.
///   It did not use to be. The padding was written <c>temp.Append(0)</c>, which binds to
///   <c>StringBuilder.Append(int)</c> and appends the *digit* zero, 0x30, rather than the
///   character. Big endian ended a byte-short string in '0'; little endian was worse, because
///   there the stray digit lands in the high half and turned a nearly complete "I" into U+3049.
///   Nothing caught it, because nothing read a byte-short Unicode string.
///
///   Written as byte arrays rather than as strings. What the lexer scans here is a byte sequence
///   and not text, half of it unprintable, and a zero byte written into a string literal is an
///   invisible character in the source that the next person to touch this file cannot see.
