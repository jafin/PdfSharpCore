/// <summary>
///   The fourth static seam: what a registered <see cref="ITextShaper"/> gets to decide, and what
///   happens when there is none. Nothing here shapes anything for real - the shapers below are
///   stubs that answer a fixed script - because the question is whether the library asks the seam
///   and believes the answer, not whether HarfBuzz works.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///   <para>
///     <see cref="GlobalFontSettings.TextShaper"/> is per application domain, and unlike the other
///     seams it is read by every path that measures or draws a character. A test that installed a
///     shaper answering every run would therefore corrupt whichever other test happened to be
///     drawing text beside it, xUnit running collections in parallel.
///   </para>
///   <para>
///     So every shaper here is <see cref="SelectiveShaper"/>: it answers for one sentinel string of
///     its own and returns null - "not mine" - for everything else, and a null answer is exactly
///     the path that falls back to the unshaped run. Concurrent tests measuring their own text get
///     the behaviour they would have got with no shaper at all. The tests are kept in one class so
///     that they do not install shapers over one another, xUnit running a class's tests in
///     sequence.
///   </para>
///   <para>
///     Hence the <c>seam-</c> on the front of every sentinel: it is what makes the string one no
///     other test in the suite could be drawing at the same moment. It reads as noise and it is
///     load-bearing. It is also deliberately <b>plain ASCII</b> - these sentinels were once made
///     unique by an invisible private-use character instead, which worked for exactly as long as
///     the whole string was shaped as one run. Itemisation gives a private-use character a run of
///     its own, script Unknown, and the sentinel then arrived at the shaper in two pieces that
///     matched nothing. A test fixture you cannot see is a test fixture you cannot debug.
