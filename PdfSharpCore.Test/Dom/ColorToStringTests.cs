///   Color.ToString used to build its colour-name table lazily, assigning the static an empty
///   Hashtable and then filling it. A thread arriving in between saw a non-null table, skipped
///   construction and read from one that was still filling; two threads inside the loop could both
///   find a key absent and both add it, which Hashtable.Add throws on; and a Hashtable supports one
///   writer, not several.
///
///   Calling Colors.Black.ToString() from 64 threads at once returned four different answers:
///   "Black", "RGB(0,0,0)", "" and ArgumentException. The middle one is the worst - it does not
///   throw and the DDL it produces still parses, so a document simply serializes with RGB(0,0,0)
///   where it should say Black.
///
///   The table is now a static readonly Dictionary built by a static initializer, which the CLR
///   guarantees runs once and completes before any thread reads the field.
