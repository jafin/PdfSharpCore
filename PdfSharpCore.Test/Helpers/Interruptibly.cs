/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// A lexer or parser handed malformed input can loop forever rather than fail, and a test that
/// calls one straight ends the whole test host instead of going red. The tests that scan such input
/// carry <c>[Fact(Timeout = …)]</c> to turn that back into a failure - and xUnit honours it only on
/// an <c>async</c> test, and only for what is not running on the test's own thread. So the work has
/// to be handed somewhere else, and every one of those tests does hand it somewhere else.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>The thread pool is the wrong somewhere.</b> xUnit starts the clock when it calls the test
/// method, so a timeout covers however long the work waited to begin as well as how long it ran.
/// Under <c>Task.Run</c> that is a queue: xUnit runs tests in parallel, coverage instrumentation
/// slows each of them, Ghostscript rasterizes inside this same process, and a CI runner has two
/// cores to spread it over. A work item can sit unstarted past the timeout, and the test then fails
/// saying it timed out having scanned nothing at all. That is what happened to
/// <c>CLexerTests.ScanHexadecimalString_readsTheBytesTheDigitsSpell</c> on a build whose only change
/// was a line in a workflow file - reported as timing out after 5000ms with a duration of 1ms, and
/// green on the re-run.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A thread of its own starts when it is told to, whatever the pool is doing, so the timeout goes
/// back to measuring the scan. That is the whole point of the class: not to move work off the test
/// thread - <c>Task.Run</c> did that much - but to stop the timeout from measuring how busy the
/// machine is.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A thread each is wasteful by the standards of ordinary code and irrelevant by the standards of
/// these tests: there are a few dozen of them, each scanning a few dozen bytes.
