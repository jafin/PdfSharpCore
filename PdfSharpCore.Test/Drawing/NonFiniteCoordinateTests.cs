/// <summary>
///   PDF has no way to write NaN or infinity. A viewer handed one stops drawing rather than
///   complaining, so the page arrives blank or half-finished with nothing to say why - and the
///   drawing call that produced it returned perfectly happily, possibly hours earlier.
///   <para>
///   Two defects found while building the demonstration app were exactly this and nothing else:
///   every column, bar, line and area chart drew its whole plot area at NaN because the axis
///   renderers read a field the property would have filled in, and every DataMatrix built by a
///   constructor that leaves Size unset drew its modules at negative infinity. Neither threw.
///   The renderer now refuses the operator instead, which turns both into a stack trace at the
///   drawing call.
