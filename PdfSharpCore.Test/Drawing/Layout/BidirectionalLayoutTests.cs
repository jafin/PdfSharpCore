///     Reordering lives in the renderer rather than in any layout engine, so a formatter that hands
///     a whole line to <c>DrawString</c> gets it right without having been changed at all. Every
///     alignment but one does exactly that. Justifying cannot - each word has to be placed at an x
///     of its own for the extra room to go between them - so the order the words are placed in is
///     the formatter's own to get right, and that is most of what is tested here.
///   </para>
///   <para>
///     Hebrew rather than Arabic, because Liberation Sans draws both Hebrew and Latin where the
///     Arabic face draws no Latin at all. These tests read glyph identifiers back and compare them,
///     so a face answering <c>.notdef</c> for half the line would make a wrong order
///     indistinguishable from a right one. Nothing here registers a shaper: Hebrew does not join,
///     and reordering is not shaping.
