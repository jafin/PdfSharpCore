///   <see cref="DdlEncoder"/> is the writing half of MDDDL's escaping: the two public methods that
///   turn a string into something the scanner will read back as that string. They escape different
///   things, because they are for different places in the grammar - running paragraph text, where a
///   brace would open a nested element and <c>//</c> would begin a comment, and a quoted literal,
///   where neither means anything but a quote ends the string.
///   <para>
///   <c>StringToText</c> had one caller and 37% coverage; <c>StringToLiteral</c> had neither a
///   caller anywhere in the repository nor a single executed line. Both are public, so the second is
///   API a consumer can reach even though nothing here does.
///   </para>
///   <para>
///   The escaping tables below say what each produces. The round trips after them are the assertion
