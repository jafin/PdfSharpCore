/// in design units can be measured, cached and drawn at every size, which is what the measuring

/// <see cref="Cluster"/> is the load-bearing member. It is an index into the text that was

/// sharing a cluster are one indivisible unit. It is what says that the two characters "f" and
/// "i" became the single glyph <c>fi</c>, and three separate things need to know that: line
/// breaking, which may only break at a cluster boundary; <c>/ToUnicode</c>, which has to map that
/// one glyph back to two characters; and <c>/ActualText</c> for tagged output, which has to say
/// the same thing to a screen reader. A shaping result without clusters can drive a screen and
