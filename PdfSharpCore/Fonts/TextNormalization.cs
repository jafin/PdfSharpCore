/// The rule is the one <c>FontHelper.MeasureString</c> has always applied and
/// <c>XGraphicsPdfRenderer.DrawString</c> never did: a tab becomes a single space, and every other
/// character below 32 is dropped. Nothing at or above 32 is touched. Drawing used to hand all of
/// them to the face's <c>cmap</c> as ordinary code points, which almost always answers
/// <c>.notdef</c> - so a string that measured as one width was drawn at another, with a box glyph
/// where a tab was meant to be.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This knows nothing about a font, a direction or a script, which is why it is not part of
/// <see cref="TextShaping"/>. It also has to run <em>before</em> shaping rather than inside it:
/// both callers keep using the original string afterwards - for the text a run stands for, for
/// what <c>/ToUnicode</c> says and for the WinAnsi bytes - so a shaper that quietly filtered
/// underneath them would hand back cluster indices into a string nobody else has.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// There is no line splitting here. <c>\n</c> falls into "everything else below 32" and is
/// dropped like the rest; a caller that wants it to mean a line break - which
/// <c>FontHelper.MeasureString</c> does, and <c>XGraphicsPdfRenderer.DrawString</c> deliberately
/// does not - intercepts it before offering the character here. Multi-line text is
/// <c>XTextFormatter</c>'s job and MigraDoc's, and both split before a string reaches either of
/// these two methods.
