/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// A <see cref="ShapedRun"/> is what a shaper answers for one run, and a run is by definition one
/// direction and one script against one face. A string handed to <c>DrawString</c> is none of
/// those: it may change script half way through, it may change direction, and the face may run out
/// of glyphs part way along - and the three changes do not fall in the same places. This is the
/// join. <see cref="PdfSharpCore.Text.TextItemizer"/> cuts by direction and script,
/// <see cref="FontFallbackResolution"/> cuts by coverage, and each piece is shaped on its own
/// terms.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The segments are in <b>visual order</b>, leftmost first, so a renderer draws them one after
/// another at the advancing pen position and gets bidirectional text right without knowing anything
/// about bidirectional text. Their <see cref="ShapedSegment.Start"/> indices therefore need not
/// ascend.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <see cref="Width"/> is in <b>points</b> rather than in design units, unlike
/// <see cref="ShapedRun.Width"/>. Two segments may have been shaped against faces with different
/// units per em, so there is no one em for the whole to be measured in.
