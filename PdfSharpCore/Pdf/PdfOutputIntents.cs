/// The exception is <see cref="PdfColorMode.Rgb"/>, and it is a large exception because it is the
/// default. Colours written as RGB by a library that was never told otherwise are sRGB — that is
/// what every reader assumes of them and what they were almost certainly authored as — so sRGB is
/// not a guess there but a description. A document claiming PDF/A with RGB colours and no profile
/// of its own gets <see cref="SrgbProfile"/> and <see cref="SrgbIdentifier"/>. A CMYK document
