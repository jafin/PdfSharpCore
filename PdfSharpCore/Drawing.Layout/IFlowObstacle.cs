/// which parts of it do you take?</i> An obstacle is never asked what shape it is, where its middle
/// is, or which side text should go - the side a line takes is a consequence of which runs are left
/// free, not an instruction, which is how the same idea landed in MigraDoc and in iText7
/// independently.

/// That is what makes this worth being an interface rather than a rectangle. A circle, a polygon and
/// an <see cref="XGraphicsPath"/> are implementations of this - flatten, intersect the band with
/// the edges, sort the crossings, pair them - and none of them needs the layout loop to change or
/// the geometry types to grow. Only <see cref="RectangleObstacle"/> ships today; the rest are
/// deliberately not built, not deliberately impossible.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Answers may be given in any order, may overlap each other, and may lie outside the block
/// entirely. <see cref="IntervalSet"/> sorts and merges them, so an implementation is free to be
