/// QuestPDF hands a single width to Skia's shaper and has no per-line seam to describe anything
/// with. Both would have been cheaper. The set is chosen because it makes taking the widest run a
/// decision the <em>layout loop</em> makes rather than a property of the type - so an obstacle with
/// a gap in it, a circle, a path, is a new implementation of
