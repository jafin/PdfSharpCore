/// This is the one piece of arithmetic the two layout engines in this solution genuinely share.
/// MigraDoc's <c>ObstructedArea</c> asks it once per line to place a paragraph beside a floating
/// shape; <see cref="XTextFormatter"/> asks it once per line to place text beside a reserved
/// region. Everything else about the two is different - MigraDoc's obstacles are page-absolute and
/// the formatter's are relative to the block, and that difference is real rather than incidental,
/// so gathering the obstacles and deciding which of them stand in a band stays with each engine.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// It takes and answers in plain doubles for that reason. A signature mentioning
/// <c>Rectangle</c>, <see cref="XRect"/> or <see cref="XUnit"/> would belong to one engine and have
/// to be converted by the other; a pair of coordinates belongs to neither.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Public because <c>MigraDocCore.Rendering</c> is a different assembly and this repository
/// deliberately carries no <c>InternalsVisibleTo</c>. Pure and stateless, so being public costs
/// little.

/// <b>The sweep itself lives in <see cref="IntervalSet"/> and this is the shorthand for it.</b> It
/// began as its own hand-rolled scan, written before there was an interval type; keeping both would
/// have been two implementations of one idea sitting in one folder, which is the thing this class
/// was extracted to stop. What is left here is the signature MigraDoc calls - doubles in, doubles
/// out - over geometry that is now written once.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// It allocates where the hand-rolled scan did not: a list of intervals and a set or two, once per
/// line. Deliberate, and cheap against what a page of glyphs costs. If it ever stops being cheap,
/// the specialisation can come back - with a test that it and <see cref="IntervalSet"/> agree,
/// which is what would have made keeping both defensible in the first place.
