/// This is the second piece of arithmetic the two layout engines in this solution genuinely share -
/// see <see cref="LineSpans"/> for the first. <see cref="XTextFormatter"/> justifies a line by
/// placing whole blocks of it; <c>MigraDocCore.Rendering.ParagraphRenderer</c> draws one show-text
/// operator per leaf. Both have to decide where each of their units belongs on a reordered line, and
/// both learned the same rule separately before this existed: order a unit by the leftmost position
/// any of its characters ends up at, not by its first character, because a right-to-left word's
/// first character is its rightmost. That is also what keeps an English phrase inside a Hebrew
/// sentence in its own order, where reversing the whole line would turn it round.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// It takes character spans and the bidi result already resolved for them, and answers a
/// permutation - which is exactly what <see cref="LineSpans"/> takes and answers in doubles instead.
/// Neither engine's notion of a unit - a <c>Block</c> in one, a leaf in the other - is known here,
/// and nothing about a font or a page is either.

/// Public because <c>MigraDocCore.Rendering</c> is a different assembly and this repository
