/// signature is written and the signature cannot be computed until they are. The way out is to write
/// the file with a hole of a known size where the signature will go, with a <c>/ByteRange</c> saying
/// "everything except that hole" — then compute the signature over what was written and patch it in
/// without moving a single byte. Every field involved is therefore written at a <b>fixed width</b>:
/// that is what makes the second pass a patch rather than a re-layout.
/// </para>
