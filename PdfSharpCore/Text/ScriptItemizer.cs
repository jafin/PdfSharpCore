/// <para>
/// <b>Internal, and asked of a window rather than of a paragraph.</b> Sweeping a Common character
/// into whatever it is beside only means something inside a stretch of text already resolved to one
/// direction: asked of the whole of "one <c>&#x0645;&#x0646;</c>", the space goes with the Latin
/// that precedes it, and <see cref="BidiAlgorithm"/> then puts that space in the middle of the
/// Arabic. A cut where there is no boundary, and the real boundary left uncut. So the only caller is
/// <see cref="TextItemizer"/>, which asks once per bidirectional run, and
/// <see cref="TextItemizer.Itemize"/> is the supported way to ask the question of a paragraph.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// UAX #24. The whole of the difficulty is that most punctuation, all spaces and every digit have
/// script <see cref="UnicodeScript.Common"/>, and combining marks have
/// <see cref="UnicodeScript.Inherited"/>: neither says anything about which script the text is in,
/// and both have to be swept into whichever run they find themselves next to. A full stop after
/// Arabic belongs to the Arabic run; the same full stop after Latin belongs to the Latin one.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>What this does not do:</b> the Script_Extensions property. A character can belong to several
/// scripts at once - U+0640 Arabic tatweel is used by Syriac and Adlam too - and <c>scx</c> is the
/// property that says so. This reads <c>sc</c> alone, which puts such a character in the script it
/// is named for rather than in whichever neighbouring script also claims it. The visible cost is a
/// run boundary where there need not be one, never a wrong glyph, and adding <c>scx</c> later is a
/// third generated table and no change to any caller.
