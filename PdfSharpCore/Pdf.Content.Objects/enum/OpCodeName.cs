/// spelling is not a legal identifier the name is spelled out: an asterisk becomes a trailing
/// <c>x</c> (<see cref="bx"/> is <c>b*</c>), and the two quote operators are
/// <see cref="QuoteSingle"/> and <see cref="QuoteDbl"/>. The descriptions are those of Table A.1 in

/// The order of the members is the order they have always had. These values are ordinal, so
