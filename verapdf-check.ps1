.SYNOPSIS
    Builds the conformance corpus and asks veraPDF whether it conforms to what it claims.

.DESCRIPTION
    Every PDF/A and PDF/UA claim this library makes is otherwise self-certified: the writer refuses
    to save a document that breaks a rule it can check, and `PdfUaValidator` says in its own remarks
    which rules those are and which it cannot reach. This is the outside opinion. It runs the same
    way on a developer's machine and on a CI runner, which is the point of it being one script.

    veraPDF runs in Docker rather than being installed. It is a Java application, and requiring a JRE
    on every machine that wants to run this - and on Windows, where a developer is least likely to
    have one - costs more than a container does. The image is pinned so that a validator release
    cannot change the answer underneath a build; raise it deliberately.

    This gates. It reported without failing for exactly as long as the corpus did not conform, which
    was the three defects the first run found - all since fixed, all with tests of their own.

    Flavour detection is left automatic, which is why every document in the corpus makes a claim.
    veraPDF reads the claim out of each file's own metadata and holds it to that profile. A file
    claiming nothing would be held to the fallback flavour instead and fail for saying nothing rather
    than for being wrong.

.PARAMETER Corpus
    Where to write the corpus and validate from. Defaults to artifacts/conformance-corpus.

.PARAMETER NoGate
    Report the verdict without failing. The corpus conforms, so a failure means something regressed
    and the default is to say so with an exit code; this is for looking at a failure rather than
    being stopped by it.

.PARAMETER SkipBuild
    Validate the corpus already on disk instead of rebuilding it. For iterating on a validation
    failure without paying for a rebuild each time.

.PARAMETER Image
    The veraPDF image to run. Pinned by default.

.EXAMPLE
    ./verapdf-check.ps1
    Build the corpus, validate it, print a summary, and fail if anything does not conform.

.EXAMPLE
    ./verapdf-check.ps1 -NoGate
    The same, but always succeed - for reading a failure rather than being stopped by it.
