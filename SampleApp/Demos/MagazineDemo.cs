///   A feature opener and its continuation: a full bleed photograph, a drop cap, and a pull quote.

/// <remarks>
///   The drop cap is a property now. It used to be thirty lines that drew the letter separately and
///   then added one word at a time to a probe rectangle until the answer stopped fitting - a
///   workaround this demo was teaching as though it were a technique. The pull quote is still
///   arithmetic: nothing in the library flows text beside a shape yet.
