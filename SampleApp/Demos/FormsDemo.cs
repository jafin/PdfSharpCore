///   An interactive form - text boxes, check boxes, radio buttons, a combo box, a list box and a

/// <remarks>
///   <para>
///     This demo used to be the odd one out. Every other demo called a method the library offers;
///     this one wrote dictionaries by hand, because <see cref="PdfAcroForm"/> and every
///     <see cref="PdfAcroField"/> under it had an <c>internal</c> constructor, the field collection
///     had no <c>Add</c>, and <see cref="PdfWidgetAnnotation"/> was internal too. The typed API
///     could fill in a form somebody else wrote. It could not make one.
///   </para>
///   <para>
///     It can now, and this is what that looks like: no <c>PdfDictionary</c>, no content-stream
///     operators, and every appearance stream drawn with <see cref="XGraphics"/> like the rest of
///     the library. Page two sets out what changed and what is still the caller's problem.
