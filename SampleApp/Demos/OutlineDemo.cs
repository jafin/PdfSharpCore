///   <para>
///     The distinction in that sentence is the whole point of the demo. An entry built from a page
///     alone writes <c>/XYZ null null null</c>, which leaves a reader wherever the page was already
///     scrolled to - so a contents list of twelve entries pointing at one page appears to do nothing
///     eleven times. Setting <see cref="PdfOutline.Top"/> is what makes it land.
///   </para>
///   <para>
///     Building this demo is what found the defect behind <see cref="PdfOutline.Opened"/>, which
///     used to be inert: a reader takes an entry's expanded state from <c>/Count</c>, and nothing
///     wrote it, so every tree arrived collapsed however it had been built. Chapter 2 below is the
///     regression test a human can see - it is the one branch asked to arrive shut, and if it ever
///     looks like the others again, the count has stopped being written.
