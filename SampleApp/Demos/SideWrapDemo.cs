///   Text running beside a shape rather than stopping above it and starting again below.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///   <para>
///     Every page here is one paragraph of prose and one text frame. Nothing measures anything,
///     nothing is split by hand, and no line is placed by arithmetic: the wrap style says which
///     side the text runs down and the renderer breaks the lines to suit. A sidebar, a pull quote
///     and a picture that the copy closes around are all the same page with a different value on
///     <c>WrapFormat.Style</c>.
///   </para>
///   <para>
///     Four pages, because <c>Left</c> and <c>Right</c> name the side the <b>text</b> occupies and
///     the opposite reading is equally natural. Seeing them side by side is the only way to be sure
///     the page is not quietly backwards, and a wrap on the wrong side is a page that looks
///     deliberate.
///   </para>
///   <para>
///     This is MigraDoc, not <c>XTextFormatter</c>. The formatter has no notion of a shape, so the
///     pull quote on the second page of the Magazine demo is still arithmetic and will stay that
///     way - it is drawn on a page rather than laid out in a document. The two engines are
///     separate, which is worth seeing in one place.
