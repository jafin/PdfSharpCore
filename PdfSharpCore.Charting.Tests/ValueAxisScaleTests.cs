///   What scale the value axis comes out at, and therefore what its tick labels read.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///   The scale is chosen by <c>YAxisRenderer.FineTuneYAxis</c>, which takes the smallest and
///   largest value plotted and answers with a minimum, a maximum and a major and minor tick. It is
///   the single most involved method in the charting package and none of its arithmetic is
///   reachable from outside: the renderer is internal and the numbers it produces live in an
///   internal renderer info.
///
///   They are legible on the page, though, because the tick labels are drawn from them - one per
///   major tick from the minimum to the maximum, formatted with the axis's format string. So the
///   labels a chart draws state the whole answer, and reading them back is how these tests ask.
///
///   The rules being pinned down here, in the order the method applies them:
///   an empty range is widened; a range whose ends differ by less than a fifth is dropped to zero,
///   which the method's own comment attributes to Excel; the step is the largest of 1, 0.5 and 0.2
///   scaled by a power of ten that fits the range; and the ends are rounded outwards by half a
///   step. None of it is documented anywhere else.
