/// <remarks>
///   Every renderer under test is internal, and this repository carries no
///   <c>InternalsVisibleTo</c>. They are reached the way anything else reaches them: by handing a
///   <see cref="Chart"/> to a <see cref="ChartFrame"/> and letting it pick the renderer, run
///   Init/Format/Draw and emit content-stream operators. That is also the only route a caller of
///   the package has, so what is covered here is covered as it is actually used.
///
///   Saved and reopened rather than read off the renderer, so that what the assertions look at is
///   the content stream as it was written rather than as it stood while it was being built.
///
///   The frame is drawn with <see cref="ChartFrame.DrawChart"/> rather than
///   <see cref="ChartFrame.Draw"/>. Draw puts a rounded shadow, a gradient-filled border and a
///   translate around the chart before it starts, and every one of those adds operators that an
///   assertion about the chart would then have to step over. DrawChart adds a translate and
///   nothing else.
