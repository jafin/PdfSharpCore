/// <summary>
///   What a page reads, as text.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///   A show-text operator does not carry text. PdfSharpCore embeds its fonts as Identity-H, so
///   what it carries is two bytes of glyph identifier per character - <c>&lt;0014&gt; Tj</c> for a
///   "1" - and those numbers are the face's own. Asserting against them would pin these tests to
///   the glyph order of Liberation Sans, which is a fact about a font file rather than about the
///   charting code.
///
///   The document says what they mean. Every Type0 font PdfSharpCore writes carries a /ToUnicode
///   CMap giving one <c>&lt;gid&gt;&lt;gid&gt;&lt;character&gt;</c> line per glyph used, which is
///   how a reader copies text out of the page - so reading it back is reading the same answer any
///   other consumer of the file would get, and a test may say <c>"0.0"</c> and mean it.
///
///   Only the forms PdfSharpCore actually emits are handled: composite fonts keyed two bytes at a
///   time, simple fonts one. Anything with no map is returned as its raw bytes, so a font the
///   library starts writing differently shows up as unreadable output rather than as silence.
///
///   One limit, and it is on the positions rather than on the text. What is followed here is the
///   text matrix, not the transformation matrix - so a run drawn under a transform is reported in
///   the space that transform set up rather than on the page. A chart applies one translate to
///   everything it draws, which cancels out of any comparison between two runs on the same page,
///   but a rotated axis title is drawn under a rotate of its own and is not comparable with
///   anything. See <c>AxisTitleTests.RotatedCaption</c>, which compares content streams instead.
