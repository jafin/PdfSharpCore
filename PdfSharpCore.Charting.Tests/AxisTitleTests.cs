///   The caption written alongside an axis.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///   <c>AxisTitleRenderer</c> draws the caption twice over: upright, where it goes into a rectangle
///   with its alignment handed to a string format, and rotated, where it goes into a rectangle
///   centred on the origin and the surface is turned under it. The rotated path is the longer of
///   the two and is what a chart with a caption up its side takes, which is the ordinary case.
///
///   It serves the value axis only, despite its name. The category axis renderers draw their own
///   caption inline at the end of their Draw, reading neither the alignment nor the orientation -
///   so half the tests here are about which of the two ways a caption is drawn, and what is lost
///   by taking the other one.
///
///   The other half of the renderer is that a title takes room. It is measured during Format and
///   the axis subtracts what it measured from what is left for the plot area - so the surest sign
///   that a title was laid out at all is that the columns moved.
